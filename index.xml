Finally given some room to govern, falls. It was a wonderful exposition into how a careful story. Well crafted. Can create a narrative that can form and hold an empire. That and rail guns keeping your main foothold to said empire in check.
Bablyon&amp;rsquo;s ashes was a fantastic addition to the expanse series. It was a page turner. A beautiful tale of megalomania and revenge.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://bneil.me/posts/first_post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 13:27:13 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/posts/first_post/</guid><description>Trying to follow along and get a build for hugo and for gemini working in github actions.

The comradery. Then here, you see people. People that want to reconnect.
It was, at this point, my investiment into the crew of the Rocinate was tested. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want these characters to leave. To explore their own backstories. But they did.
Then rocks fell and all shit went haywire. It was glorius.
Naomi&amp;rsquo;s character ark in particular was so spectacular that I had on occasion just had to stop gushing.</description></item><item><title>Cibola Burn</title><link>https://bneil.me/review/books/cibola_burn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:48:53 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/review/books/cibola_burn/</guid><description>He reaches out Sometimes I read a book and I start laughing at just how bad things keep getting regardless of the beste intentions of the characters in the book. Having now gone through a few of these expanse books, I knew that the crew of the Rocinante, were going to see wild things in the through the gates. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even imagine how entertaining the middle of this book would be.</description></item><item><title>Abaddons Gate</title><link>https://bneil.me/review/books/abaddons_gate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 19:22:33 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/review/books/abaddons_gate/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m burning through these books and this one was no different.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the instant draw.
To characters whose only hope of kindling a romantic hookup is belting themselves into a junker spaceship and hurling themselves through a gate built from the reconstituted remains of Venus.
But damn.
The flair seems so human, I could see it being real.
Abaddon&amp;rsquo;s Gate centers around the aforementioned ring. It&amp;rsquo;s existence bringing the whole of humanity towards it.</description></item><item><title>Calibans War</title><link>https://bneil.me/review/books/calibans_war/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 10:33:49 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/review/books/calibans_war/</guid><description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put this title down from page one. Where in Leviathans Wake I was impressed by the world building and just wild adventure, in caliban&amp;rsquo;s war the character and story arcs are on a completely different level. From a war breaking out in the solar systems only bread basket too running full throttle towards a space mutant and even a kidnapping - I was absolutely delighted.
All while introducing characters like Avasarala, a head strong - tactical politician boss bitch archetype and Bobby a gunnery sergeant who&amp;rsquo;s mental health is threatened very early in the book.</description></item><item><title>Leviathan Wakes</title><link>https://bneil.me/review/books/leviathan_wakes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 10:33:49 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/review/books/leviathan_wakes/</guid><description>Really great world building, interesting plot and just enough tension to really feel like an adventure. I was a little confused when reading this book at first since the prologue was really odd. That and the whiplash we get as we are first getting introduced into the world that James Corey paints for us.
For me my favorite character was Miller, and I was enjoying the tug of what felt like two protagonists in a single story.</description></item><item><title>Connecting/Migrations in RDS</title><link>https://bneil.me/notes/note_connecting_to_rds/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 17:03:50 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/notes/note_connecting_to_rds/</guid><description>Goose Since goose uses pq under the hood, to hit remote urls

Lots and lots of pain. Including the fact id probably end up having to use dynamodb streams and couple that with elasticsearch. So im not going to even entertain that idea and am going down the ol trusty sql route.
Creating the database Im still on an older version of terraform, so public shamming for being on 0.</description></item><item><title>Audit Service - Dynamodb</title><link>https://bneil.me/posts/audit-dynamodb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 11:13:53 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/posts/audit-dynamodb/</guid><description>Audit Service Description Decided that I wanted an audit db and service to help keep track of user behaviors. Since I already have some in Redis, and some in Postgres I thought this might be a useful exercise. The main thing id like to accomplish with this code is going to be a way to track events and break them down by week/month/year per user and per company.
Im having some self debate about creating tables for the tallies or if I should just be creating them on the fly using a query.</description></item><item><title>Dynamo DB Pages</title><link>https://bneil.me/notes/dynamodb_pages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 10:33:49 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/notes/dynamodb_pages/</guid><description>Dynamo code snippet Recently got burned because we needed to do a recursive paging through dynamo

So far ive gotten the underpinnings done by creating a dynamo store
The main struct looks like this
type DynamoStore struct { tableName string primaryKey string store *dynamodb.DynamoDB } The funny thing is that im basically treating dynamo in the same way I was treating redis. Which is as primarily a key value store.</description></item><item><title>On Notes</title><link>https://bneil.me/notes/2021-04-19-taking-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 16:27:57 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/notes/2021-04-19-taking-notes/</guid><description>Hugo for note taking I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if using Hugo for writing notes would even be applicable to my current work flows. Right now I usually just use Evernote, but then I never really go into Evernote and re-review all the things ive noted.
I keep feeling like there has to be a way to manage GTD, alongside tools that im working with daily because seriously, the amount of context switching in terms of apps/sites to plan any one project seems crazy.</description></item><item><title>WASM and Webmentions</title><link>https://bneil.me/posts/wasm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:36:52 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/posts/wasm/</guid><description>Webmentions So as I journey through the fun webmentions, it looks like since im just using github pages, I would migrate over to using cloudflare so I could play more with webworkers.

It all started with finding a webring. I hadnt seen one since the mid 90&amp;rsquo;s and the accidental stumbling upon one was almost magical. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had the pleasure, a web ring was this piece of tech that was largely social. It was a way of finding genres of websites you were interested in and daisy chaining between them. Largely this was before google owned search and the &amp;lsquo;little&amp;rsquo; guys like alta vista were king.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://bneil.me/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/about/</guid><description>My name is Benjamin Neil, a polyglot engineer in Colorado.

Which got me thinking about how I could setup my own non distributable layers.
So looking into microsoft/windowsservercore I figured since those had some foreign layers I could take a gander at what was in the manifest which made particular layers &amp;ldquo;foreign&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
