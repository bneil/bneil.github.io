Lots and lots of pain. Including the fact id probably end up having to use dynamodb streams and couple that with elasticsearch. So im not going to even entertain that idea and am going down the ol trusty sql route.
Creating the database Im still on an older version of terraform, so public shamming for being on 0.</description></item><item><title>Audit Service - Dynamodb</title><link>/post/audit-dynamodb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 11:13:53 -0600</pubDate><guid>/post/audit-dynamodb/</guid><description>Audit Service Description Decided that I wanted an audit db and service to help keep track of user behaviors. Since I already have some in Redis, and some in Postgres I thought this might be a useful exercise. The main thing id like to accomplish with this code is going to be a way to track events and break them down by week/month/year per user and per company.
Im having some self debate about creating tables for the tallies or if I should just be creating them on the fly using a query.</description></item><item><title>Dynamo DB Pages</title><link>/post/dynamodb_pages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 10:33:49 -0600</pubDate><guid>/post/dynamodb_pages/</guid><description>Dynamo code snippet Recently got burned because we needed to do a recursive paging through dynamo

Whats Great Been really enjoying getting back into the game. After a few hours I even got to see a sand worm comes flying out of the ground.

So far ive gotten the underpinnings done by creating a dynamo store
The main struct looks like this
type DynamoStore struct { tableName string primaryKey string store *dynamodb.DynamoDB } The funny thing is that im basically treating dynamo in the same way I was treating redis. Which is as primarily a key value store.</description></item><item><title>On Notes</title><link>/post/2021-04-19-taking-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 16:27:57 -0600</pubDate><guid>/post/2021-04-19-taking-notes/</guid><description>Hugo for note taking I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if using Hugo for writing notes would even be applicable to my current work flows. Right now I usually just use Evernote, but then I never really go into Evernote and re-review all the things ive noted.
I keep feeling like there has to be a way to manage GTD, alongside tools that im working with daily because seriously, the amount of context switching in terms of apps/sites to plan any one project seems crazy.</description></item><item><title>WASM and Webmentions</title><link>/post/wasm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:36:52 -0600</pubDate><guid>/post/wasm/</guid><description>Webmentions So as I journey through the fun webmentions, it looks like since im just using github pages, I would migrate over to using cloudflare so I could play more with webworkers. My last attempt was that Danny Devito Quote generator that I believe was working fairly well.
Although, having said that it really isnt at the point id like it to be.

It all started with finding a webring. I hadnt seen one since the mid 90&amp;rsquo;s and the accidental stumbling upon one was almost magical. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had the pleasure, a web ring was this piece of tech that was largely social. It was a way of finding genres of websites you were interested in and daisy chaining between them. Largely this was before google owned search and the &amp;lsquo;little&amp;rsquo; guys like alta vista were king.</description></item><item><title>Nondistributable Artifacts</title><link>/post/docker-nondistributable-artifacts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/docker-nondistributable-artifacts/</guid><description>The Mystery I was reading through the docker documentation for docker registry and ran into this curious idea of nondistributable artifacts and how that related to some layers that are proprietary. Which got me thinking about how I could setup my own non distributable layers.
So looking into microsoft/windowsservercore I figured since those had some foreign layers I could take a gander at what was in the manifest which made particular layers &amp;ldquo;foreign&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title/><link>/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/resume/</guid><description>This is what ive been up to Technical Overview I really use alot of tech soup - so these change all the time
