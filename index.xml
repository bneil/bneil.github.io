So im going to try and come up with posts this month at a larger clip. So be prepared for some ideas that I can do on a daily basis.
One thing that usually detracts from these sorts of challenges is that its so hard to just submit work that isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo;. That whole quest for perfectionalism is a tough one.</description><webmention/></item><item><title>weekly-writeup (week 4 of Oct 2023)</title><link>https://bneil.me/posts/2023-10-29-weekly-writeup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 05:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/posts/2023-10-29-weekly-writeup/</guid><description>Highlights had a bee try and take me out while picking up the kids lots of wins doing managerial tasks ended up watching a really great video by Amy Hupe got a few runs in!

Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the instant draw.
To characters whose only hope of kindling a romantic hookup is belting themselves into a junker spaceship and hurling themselves through a gate built from the reconstituted remains of Venus.
But damn.
The flair seems so human, I could see it being real.
Abaddon&amp;rsquo;s Gate centers around the aforementioned ring.

I have had the privilege to work the past eleven years making websites, services, documentation and tools for amazing companies.
I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with technology and programming - mainy linux, hypervisors, containers, unikernels, scala, rust, go etc. Ive got a real problem researching tools and enjoy writing then rewriting internal documentation.
Publications Recently (well in 2016) I co-authored a book called Professional Scala, it was an exciting experience and I really enjoyed the feedback from the scala community.</description><webmention/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://bneil.me/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bneil.me/contact/</guid><description>Have questions or want to discuss programming?
