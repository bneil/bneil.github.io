&lt;p>I don’t really have a favorite food. But if its before 11 a.m., I’ll 100% say omelettes. Its the sandwich of the breakfast hour and I really enjoy the myriad of ways you can make them.

Personally love using spinach, feta and jalapeno.

<p>Ive always been a breakfast lover. Usually my goto for a breakfast place is eggs over medium, sourdough toast and turkey sausage / hashbrowns if they have it. I like the simplicity and the fact ive had it so many times.</p>
<p>As for history? I’ve always been a breakfast nerd. When I was a kid, my mom would make these massive, chaotic omelettes (or these really interesting potato pancakes) on Sundays. She’d throw in whatever was in the fridge—canned mushrooms, ham, cheese that came in a foil wrapper. I thought it was gourmet. Now I do the same thing, but with better knives and a fancier pan, maybe (just maybe) a little more focus on the ol ingredients. The difference is im not as brave as her. joking, im joking.</p>
<p>I will say, omelettes, burritos and sandwiches all have the same vibe. We are just packing a starch. Which is amazing and kinda neat when you think about it. So many thousands of years and so much of what we make is a variation of these common themes. I kinda wonder what master chiefs think about their craft. Like, at what point is the variation considered new. what constitutes &rsquo;new&rsquo; and what is just an amalgamation of &lsquo;cube theory&rsquo;..</p>

<p>I enjoy alcohol, and I can understand how it’s been the <strong>go-to depressant</strong> for thousands of years.</p>
<p>|&gt; What I Like</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, it’s given me a respite from some bad anxiety I’ve had in the past. For example, I have this issue with stomach pains—like, I literally think I’m going to be sick sometimes after eating food for zero reason—but if I take a shot or have a beer, suddenly that brain I love (and that runs my life) finally takes a break from trying to think me into sickness, and I can enjoy my night.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2 id="day-18-how-do-you-feel-about-alcohol-is-it-something-you-enjoy-what-do-you-like-what-do-you-dislike">Day 18: How Do You Feel About Alcohol?

<p>I enjoy alcohol, and I can understand how it’s been the <strong>go-to depressant</strong> for thousands of years.</p>
<p>|&gt; What I Like</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, it’s given me a respite from some bad anxiety I’ve had in the past. For example, I have this issue with stomach pains—like, I literally think I’m going to be sick sometimes after eating food for zero reason—but if I take a shot or have a beer, suddenly that brain I love (and that runs my life) finally takes a break from trying to think me into sickness, and I can enjoy my night.</p>
<p>I also enjoy how socially accepted it is. I went on a bike ride a few days back, got to a nice venue, ordered a beer, and watched the sunset. It was the perfect ending to a long day pedaling. Lots of people were there drinking; it’s just a very social activity — or it can be. There aren’t many other drugs with that kind of universal acceptance.</p>
<p>|&gt; What I Dislike</p>
<p>It’s a monkey on your back. My best rule of thumb for drinking is: when I notice I <em>want</em> another one, I stop. Don’t ask me why I’m my own worst enemy. Don’t ask me how many times it took to learn that habit either. I just know that when I really crave another shot or beer, it’s time for water — and probably time to call it a night.</p>
<p>Alcohol is simple, and it reminds me of when I smoked constantly. You can take it for granted, and that’s when it starts causing harm.</p>
<p>I remember 2020 — I built a bar in my basement. I’d never mixed drinks before, but jeez, trying to keep things balanced while lining up a Margarita, Mojito, Old Fashioned, Cosmopolitan, and Martini? It takes skill, but my god, those mornings after. Don’t even get me started. If you’re older than 30 (or younger, jeez), those mornings where it takes half the day to feel human again? That’s when you realize your body isn’t built for this. It’s great in the moment, but long-term? Not for me.</p>
<p>So yeah, ups and downs like anything. But it’s been nice curbing it a bit these last few years. Waking up to coffee and tech articles without a hangover? Priceless.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-learned-so-far">What I&rsquo;ve Learned So Far</h2>
<p>Honestly? Writing regularly is harder than I thought it would be, but also more rewarding. Some days the prompts spark something interesting, other days I&rsquo;m just trying to get words on the page. But that&rsquo;s kind of the beauty of it - not every post has to be profound. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just nice to capture a moment or a thought.</p>
<p>Take a look through 50of50 tag which has become my little breadcrumb trail for this experiment. It&rsquo;s been fun to look back and see the variety of topics and moods. Road trips, personal philosophies, random observations - it&rsquo;s all there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about doing something similar, my advice? Don&rsquo;t worry too much about the timeline. The writing is the point, not the schedule.</p>

<p>When it comes to writing, there&rsquo;s a fine line between being authentic and oversharing.

<p>When it comes to writing, there&rsquo;s a fine line between being authentic and oversharing. While it&rsquo;s easy to pour out my thoughts on the world, the weather, or even the book, diving into deeply personal experiences is where things get complicated. There is a certain vulnerability that comes with sharing parts of yourself that you&rsquo;ve kept hidden, and it&rsquo;s not always worth the risk of exposure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that the hardest things to write about are the moments that have shaped me, the failures and successes that have left indelible marks.</p>
<p>These are the stories that, while powerful, feel too raw to be shared with the world. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m afraid of judgment, but rather that I&rsquo;m protective of the parts of myself that are vulnerable. That were raw, that I worked on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a comfort in keeping stories to myself, a sense of control over my own narrative that I&rsquo;m not ready to let go of.</p>
<p>Yet, there&rsquo;s a part of me that yearns to share, to connect with others on a deeper level. Maybe its an only child thing.</p>
<p>Writing is, after all, a form of communication, a way to bridge the gap experiences with another&rsquo;s understanding. But for now, I&rsquo;ll keep those personal stories personal and over time gain some confidence, and share, if i feel comfortable in the future.</p>

What makes you that way?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’d say I’m an early adopter for any technology that’s affordable. If it’s cheap, I’ve picked it up or deployed it in some fashion—often with mixed results. In fact, while not physical tech, when Docker first got on the scene, I was installing so much random software it might as well have been a CD of shareware. I’d spin up containers for half-baked projects, break them, rebuild them, and repeat until something stuck. It wasn’t about utility; it was about curiosity.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2 id="day-15-are-you-an-early-or-late-adopter-of-technology-what-makes-you-that-way">Day 15, Are you an early or late adopter of technology?

<p>I’d say I’m an early adopter for any technology that’s affordable. If it’s cheap, I’ve picked it up or deployed it in some fashion—often with mixed results. In fact, while not physical tech, when Docker first got on the scene, I was installing so much random software it might as well have been a CD of shareware. I’d spin up containers for half-baked projects, break them, rebuild them, and repeat until something stuck. It wasn’t about utility; it was about curiosity.</p>
<p>I love deploying software and seeing what unique take some tool will have over another. I love experimenting with new workflows utilizing technology. I love failing. There’s a strange satisfaction in burning through a dozen half-working apps, only to retreat to a pen and notebook, scribbling ideas that might one day become the next obsession.</p>
<p>So much of technology is this push and pull.</p>
<p>This excitement cycle to finally have the friction leave, to have a promise fulfilled, only to find out that it was kinda nice before technology was around. Efficiency isn’t always the point - sometimes it’s the struggle that makes the solution feel earned.</p>
<p>I’ve said it a lot over the years: I didn’t think in the early 90’s that the internet was going to be that large. When I was connecting to BBS’s or even AOL, it didn’t feel like the web was vast. We had physical yellow page book with urls to most sites, it felt like a clubhouse. I wouldn’t have thought so many people would be using it so much back then to now. Kinda crazy.</p>
<p>And yet, here we are. The cycle continues. I’m still chasing the rush of trying new tech, something that might not work, something that might vanish in a year. Maybe it’s the thrill of the unknown, or maybe I’m just addicted to tinkering.</p>
<p>Either way, I can’t wait to see what great towers rise and fall over the coming decades.</p>
<p>Fragmented sentences aside, I’m grateful RSS is still around, heh, proof that some tech doesn’t need to much to survive. It just takes root.</p>

<p>My earliest memories were of being in a Dodge van, listening to a gray cassette tape player of George Thorogood and the Destroyers. But, given the question, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your relationship been like?&rdquo; Hmm. I&rsquo;d say that music is abundant.

<p>My earliest memories were of being in a Dodge van, listening to a gray cassette tape player of George Thorogood and the Destroyers. But, given the question, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your relationship been like?&rdquo; Hmm. I&rsquo;d say that music is abundant. It&rsquo;s almost like a color, that it finds its way into your life regardless of your opinion of it. But to directly answer, that relationship has been a good one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the music I&rsquo;ve heard. I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of hearing many different kinds. It&rsquo;s a really cool thing.</p>
<p>I remember reading The Secret Cave: Discovering Lascaux, and while it was just a hypothesis (I think) in the book, the idea of music being so prevalent even in the Paleolithic era is a true lodestone for humanity. If music meant something to them, and even now means something to me, well, I think that says something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to answer something so fundamental if I&rsquo;m being honest.</p>
<p>My grandfather played in a jazz band. When he passed, he left a lot of sheet music in his wake, but I&rsquo;ve never found a single CD of the music he played. Sometimes, I strain my memory for the few times I have heard him play jazz. He played an alto sax and I remember it being so loud. So dissonant. But it was in the band that his work gets lost in my memory. Which if I&rsquo;m being honest makes me sad. I kinda wish I could remember more from his performances that I heard. Kinda feel bad I didn&rsquo;t have a sharper memory then. But, I try to forgive myself. It&rsquo;s not like you can take notes of a band playing songs in the middle of a summer night&rsquo;s heat. You just hold onto a fleeting tune. A whisper of a moment that passed.</p>
<p>Music holds a special place in my heart. I&rsquo;m sure many people&rsquo;s hearts. It&rsquo;s a common place I think. Regardless of the genre. It&rsquo;s a tuning fork.</p>

Between the wildfire smoke that seems to roll in every year now and those temperature inversions that trap all the Front Range pollution, there are way too many days where I&rsquo;m checking the air quality index before deciding if I can even go for a run or bike ride.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this weird modern anxiety - looking at a perfectly sunny day but knowing the air is gross. The wildfires have gotten so predictable that I almost budget for it mentally, like &ldquo;alright, sometime between July and September we are going to have at least a week or two where everything smells like a delicious campfire and the mountains disappear behind this apocalyptic haze w/ a lovely red sun.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s not just the big dramatic fire days - it&rsquo;s those code orange alerts where you&rsquo;re supposed to limit outdoor activity, but life still has to happen.</p>
<p>I still need to mow the lawn, the dog still needs walks, and honestly, being cooped up inside for days on end because the air is unhealthy just adds this layer of claustrophobia to summer that didn&rsquo;t used to exist. Or reminds me of keeping inside during the pandemic (which did it officially end? I don&rsquo;t know if that was ever called).</p>
<p>It makes me realize how much we take clean air for granted until it&rsquo;s not there. Which is also kinda funny given that I just heard Space Balls 2 is coming out in a year or so.</p>

<p>The only hobby I can think of is Magic: The Gathering. To be honest, I just transitioned that obsession/hobby into different interests. I still really enjoy deck-building games and, if anything, enjoy them more without the mana drought. Also, times have just changed; I used to play in high school and college. But those people and those daily opportunities are no longer a available. But I am still happy to say I haven&rsquo;t gotten rid of the cards and still browse through my hoard when I get a chance.

I really enjoy the art. There was something, how do I put it, almost &lsquo;garbage pale kids&rsquo; about some of that 4th generation artwork.</p>
<p>Looking back, I can rationalize that MtG was more than just a game for me; it was a social activity that connected me with peers. The strategic depth and the creative aspect of deck-building were incredibly addicting, and I miss the sense of comradery that came with it. However, life has a way of moving on, and new interests dwarf old.</p>
<p>I still hold onto that piece of my past, though, and every now and then, I find myself reminiscing about the good old days when I was deeply engrossed in the world. Looking through inquest magazine and spending nights, tweaking my deck to better my friends on the bus. idk, that person is still me, just not me anymore.</p>
<p>What a fun prompt.</p>

<p>Its complicated. I love technology but its lately been giving me more an more anxiety. Mostly because I was one of those people who drew alot of self satisfaction at being a programmer. Specifically, spending the time and money it would take to get really good at specific languages. Really get the benefit from those languages and really crank out ideas into code. As such, I thought I would code the rest of my life, enjoying the whiskey and keystrokes. Cursing into my dying breathe that I finally found the one comma I had errantly put onto the end of a code block. But given where AI is at, I worry that Moore&rsquo;s Law could be in play, that the bet I made as a six year old was wrong and im cooked.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2 id="day-11-what-is-your-current-relationship-with-technology-do-you-enjoy-it-does-it-cause-you-anxiety">Day 11, What is your current relationship with technology?

<p>I still love technology and more over, I love the internet. In the communities ive been apart of and the people connected with. I&rsquo;ve found so many, many amazing people that I never would have known about without it.</p>
<p>So I still enjoy tech. With the caveat it can do a lot of good, but can also do harm and I really, realllly hope im not helping the latter.</p>

<p>I really enjoy it. When I was younger, as I mentioned in a previous <a href="/posts/2025-06-12-day05-of-50-blog-posts">post</a>, I touched on this a bit. But honestly, I lose myself in physical labor. It&rsquo;s affirming.

It&rsquo;s one reason I&rsquo;ve kept running into my 40s and really enjoy going on bike rides whenever I can.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2 id="day-10-whats-your-relationship-with-physical-labor-do-you-enjoy-accept-or-avoid-it">Day 10: What&rsquo;s Your Relationship with Physical Labor?

<p>I really enjoy it. When I was younger, as I mentioned in a previous <a href="https://bneil.me/posts/2025-06-12-day05-of-50-blog-posts">post</a>, I touched on this a bit. But honestly, I lose myself in physical labor. It&rsquo;s affirming. That&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t get anything from mental work; it&rsquo;s just that I think the raw expression of effort is a great feeling. It&rsquo;s one reason I&rsquo;ve kept running into my 40s and really enjoy going on bike rides whenever I can.</p>
<p>If I can take a moment to complain, which I realize isn&rsquo;t great according to stoic principles, ie “Don’t be overheard complaining…Not even to yourself” but man, I want more time off. The company I work for saved me, and I feel a lot of guilt even thinking about taking some time off. But when I didn&rsquo;t have a job, when I was spending weeks stressing about how to afford my mortgage, I had the time. I didn&rsquo;t use it because I needed a job. So then I got a job, and now, thankfully, I have a little breathing room to live. I just want to ride a bike, to run, to push myself and find out what I&rsquo;m capable of.</p>
<p>Life is a hustle—for me and for others. I just get tired. I get worried. We only get one spin on this rock, and I am so scared I&rsquo;m going to miss it. Whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo; is, because I&rsquo;m too busy working.</p>
<p>Physical labor? I think it reminds me of who I am. I&rsquo;m thankful for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found that there&rsquo;s a certain satisfaction in seeing the tangible results of my efforts. Whether it&rsquo;s a lawn I&rsquo;ve spent a year on, a room I&rsquo;ve cleaned, or a project I&rsquo;ve completed, the sense of accomplishment is unparalleled. It&rsquo;s a reminder that I&rsquo;m not just a cog in a machine, but a creator, an inventor, a human.</p>
<p>Moreover, physical labor has a way of grounding me. In a world that can feel abstract due to the amount of time im online, there&rsquo;s something profoundly reassuring about the concrete, the real. It&rsquo;s a break from technology and the endless stream of information that I consume.</p>
<p>So, do I enjoy physical labor? Absolutely. Do I accept it? Yes, because it&rsquo;s a part of life, a part of who I am. And do I avoid it? Never, because I know that it&rsquo;s in those moments of effort that I find a piece of myself that I can&rsquo;t find anywhere else.</p>

<p>Yes, actually really enjoy writing in a journal and always putting a &lsquo;highlight&rsquo; around what happened that day.

It was really interesting to put to paper three things each day I was grateful for, like, easily something I was never really thinking about. So mostly, im grateful for small things.

<p>I believe birthdays should have been for pie and not cake. That most meetings could be a blog article in a wiki. That people complain about the things that they wish they could get away with. These are the small rebellions of thought that feel true to me, even if they swim against the current.</p>
<p>But in terms of dislike, I personally try to only &lsquo;dislike&rsquo; things in the present. Letting those thoughts fall away, quickly. There&rsquo;s something exhausting about carrying grudges against abstract concepts or popular trends. Better to acknowledge the feeling and move on.</p>
<p>So as for disliking something that many people like.. maybe cars. I went to a lot of car shows as a kid. I didn&rsquo;t get it. Still don&rsquo;t. The discussions between two equally working engine blocks, I did like the paint jobs, but the discussions usually didn&rsquo;t feel very applicable*. It all felt like theater I couldn&rsquo;t follow. But I will gladly watch a thirty-minute YouTube video about a custom gaming rig that someone is proud of. The cable management, the RGB lighting choices, the careful component selection. So maybe we get variations of addictions, different flavors of obsession that speak to us for reasons we can&rsquo;t quite explain.</p>
<p>I mean, I try and take the kids to our version of Comic Con around here. Who knows the irreparable damage I&rsquo;m doing, passing along my particular brand of enthusiasm. But isn&rsquo;t that what we do? We share what moves us and hope something sticks, hope they find their own version of wonder in the world.</p>
<p><em>* as an aside, my dad did spend alot of time on cars, with fixing them up in the fifties and sixties so its probably just a club kinda thing. Who doesn&rsquo;t love some shared hobby.</em></p>

<p>When I was younger I thought it was pretty good. But I&rsquo;ll be honest, once I&rsquo;d moved away from the parents twenty years back, the times I&rsquo;ve worked with folks of that same age range has been limited.

But I&rsquo;ll be honest, once I&rsquo;d moved away from the parents twenty years back, the times I&rsquo;ve worked with folks of that same age range has been limited. The ones I&rsquo;ve worked with have always been great. We&rsquo;ve differed on subjects that would make sense given the amount of social change during our lifetimes. But all in all usually good.</p>
<p>Looking back, I think there&rsquo;s something to be said for the patience they showed me when I was still figuring things out. Maybe it&rsquo;s easier to appreciate that now, with some distance and perspective. These weren&rsquo;t people trying to be my friends or impress me – they were just doing their jobs, sharing, living their lives, and somehow making space for a younger person who probably thought they knew more than they did. There&rsquo;s a certain steadiness to that generation that I find myself missing sometimes, especially in professional settings where everything feels like it needs to be disrupted or optimized.</p>
<p>On a slight tangent, I will say, I don&rsquo;t think <em>everyone</em> was ready for the internet.</p>
<p>Ready for echo chambers. Ready for the dissolving of classical media. I&rsquo;ve personally tried to help, and point people towards RSS and other pieces of the small web, rather than pushing people towards more complex and toxic social media. I mean, not everyone needs to be exposed to, how did Bo Burnham say it, &lsquo;Anything and everything. All of the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The thing is, watching my parents&rsquo; generation navigate this digital shift has been both heartbreaking and fascinating. Some adapted beautifully, found new communities, learned to video call grandkids. Others got swept up in the worst parts – the conspiracy theories, the clickbait or negative algorithms, just the way social media can amplify every fear and grievance until it becomes a worldview.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent enough hours trying to explain why that some random Facebook post might not be reliable, or why maybe they don&rsquo;t need to re-share political memes that cross their feed.  It used to get exhausting, but I kept up the good fight because I remembered how they used to be the ones teaching me (im speaking more to my parents specifically at this point) to think critically about what I read and heard.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, those roles reversed, and I&rsquo;m not sure I (any) of us were ready for that.</p>

<p>Easy enough. My most memorable job was one my father gave me in the summer of 1996. I was presented with a few tons of sand/dirt that had been moved from a sewer trench – not exactly the glamorous of summer gigs most teenagers dream about, but it would become something far more significant than I could have imagined.</p>
<p>The job was deceptively simple in concept: take a wheelbarrow full of dirt, walk to the end of the cliffs, dump the dirt, repeat. Day after day, load by load, until every grain was relocated. I started each morning around 7am when the air was still cool and the world felt fresh with possibility. I&rsquo;d work steadily until noon, when the sun became too intense and my energy started to flag.

<p>Easy enough. My most memorable job was one my father gave me in the summer of 1996. I was presented with a few tons of sand/dirt that had been moved from a sewer trench – not exactly the glamorous of summer gigs most teenagers dream about, but it would become something far more significant than I could have imagined.</p>
<p>The job was deceptively simple in concept: take a wheelbarrow full of dirt, walk to the end of the cliffs, dump the dirt, repeat. Day after day, load by load, until every grain was relocated. I started each morning around 7am when the air was still cool and the world felt fresh with possibility. I&rsquo;d work steadily until noon, when the sun became too intense and my energy started to flag. After taking a few hours off during the peak heat – usually spent in whatever shade I could find, gulping water and trying to cool down – I&rsquo;d return around 2pm and push through until 5pm.</p>
<p>During those long hours, I really got into the rhythm of it all. There&rsquo;s something meditative about repetitive physical labor when you surrender to it completely. Load, walk, dump, return. Load, walk, dump, return. Your mind starts to drift and wander while your body falls into this steady, dependable cadence. The wheelbarrow became an extension of myself, the path to the cliff&rsquo;s edge as familiar as the hallway in my own house.</p>
<p>More importantly, I had my trusty bright orange Sony Walkman clipped to my belt – that miraculous piece of tech felt like pure magic in 1996. The weight of it bouncing against my hip as I walked became part of the rhythm too. I would constantly flip between the local FM station and a Weird Al tape that I&rsquo;d probably listened to a hundred times already. The contrast was perfect: sometimes I&rsquo;d be moving dirt to the soundtrack of whatever Top 40 hits were dominating that summer, and other times I&rsquo;d be hauling sand while &ldquo;Eat It&rdquo; or &ldquo;Like a Surgeon&rdquo; played in my headphones, making me chuckle despite the sweat dripping down my face.</p>
<p>Those DJs became my constant companions in a strange way. I would have enjoyed the summer regardless – there was something deeply satisfying about the raw, honest labor of the work that I really connected with. But what made it truly special was this ongoing storyline playing out on the radio. The local DJs were planning their wedding that summer, and it became this daily soap opera that I was completely invested in. They&rsquo;d talk about venue planning, menu choices, family drama, pre-wedding jitters, the fact that the radio station didn&rsquo;t allow office romance (take that jim and pam) – all the intimate details of their relationship unfolding in real time between song sets (go 91x). I don&rsquo;t know why, but it made everything feel special, like I was part of something bigger than just me and my wheelbarrow and this mountain of dirt.</p>
<p>Sometimes life is weird in how the best jobs we have don&rsquo;t need to carry some profound meaning or grand purpose. They don&rsquo;t need to align with our career goals or look impressive on a resume. Sometimes the most memorable work is just moving dirt and refusing to give up, finding satisfaction in the simple act of completion, in seeing a job through to the end no matter how humble or unglamorous it might be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said for work that demands nothing from you but your physical presence and persistence. No complex problem-solving, no office politics, no emails or meetings or performance reviews. Just you, the task at hand, and the slow but steady progress that comes from showing up day after day. In our modern world of endless complications and digital distractions, there&rsquo;s an almost radical simplicity to that kind of labor.</p>
<p>The summer heat was brutal some days, and my hands developed calluses that took months to fade. My back ached, my shoulders burned, and there were definitely moments when I questioned whether this was really how I wanted to spend my vacation. But there was also something deeply grounding about it all – literally and figuratively. I was connected to the job in the most basic way possible, moving it from one place to another with nothing but my own strength and determination.</p>
<p>Took me about two months of daily effort, and I got it mostly moved. Mostly. I was a teenager after all, and perfection wasn&rsquo;t exactly my strong suit back then. But &ldquo;mostly&rdquo; was good enough for my father, good enough for the job, and certainly good enough for me. Sometimes that&rsquo;s all any of us can hope for – to show up, do our best, and get the job mostly done.</p>
<p>Looking back now, decades later, I realize that summer taught me more about work ethic and finding joy in simple things than any classroom or corporate training ever could. It wasn&rsquo;t just about moving dirt – it was about discovering that satisfaction doesn&rsquo;t always come from complexity or prestige. Sometimes it comes from a steady rhythm, good music, and the knowledge that you&rsquo;re exactly where you&rsquo;re supposed to be, doing exactly what needs to be done.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I&rsquo;ve had a number of remarkable women in my life that I could look up to and admire. But, if I had to name one in particular, I&rsquo;d say that I deeply admire my mom. She has been and continues to be a pillar of strength for me. Her dedication to her past work as a nurse and her unwavering commitment to her family have always been inspiring. In the past, she uniquely balanced her nursing life with her role as a mom, doing it all with grace and determination. Her kindness, empathy, and wisdom have shaped me into the person I am today. She always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and supported me unconditionally. Her guidance has set a standard for what is expected of me as a man, later enabling me to be a good father and show my kids love and guidance.

<p>The easy answer would be the food. But if I was to dig a little deeper, its the feeling of space combined with good cheer. I like the fact that I can spend time with my family over a meal that ill enjoy. Its funny, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I have a favorite restaurant. But I have restaurants I enjoy dining at with the family. Usually that means the place has is relaxed, has a good menu and the people working there appear to be enjoying themselves.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2 id="day-3-why-do-you-like-your-favorite-restaurant">Day 3, Why do you like your favorite restaurant?</h2>

Even started a startup once with a friend with the hopes of just treating employees better than any other company. We did what we could as a startup while still doing everything for people that believed in our product.

<p>Now mostly mute, probably anything political. When I was younger the idea of talking about policy, any policy, seemed to come easier with groups of people. But whether its human nature or the people ive interacted with. Discussing policy is never enough, it always leads into the over arching narrative of one political preference. Personally, if you know me, you know the policies I would choose. So I don&rsquo;t really feel the need to debate those online. So.. mute.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to aim for 50 posts in 50 days, but you know what, I think ill do try best.</p>
<h2 id="day-1-a-road-trip-youve-taken-that-was-memorable">Day 1, A road trip you&rsquo;ve taken that was memorable</h2>
<p>So many road trips are memorable. That&rsquo;s one of the great things about a road trip, it&rsquo;s a break from the doldrums of daily life. But, if I was to be pressed on it, id say a memorable road trip from the past few years was definitely the trip to mesa verde. At the time, my kids were around five and eight years old. I had started the trip by presenting each a bear whistle. Since we would be going and staying a night or two in &lsquo;bear country&rsquo;. Well, that was the start to the memory. A loud, ringing, painful start.</p>
<p>After pulling up to the Mc Donald&rsquo;s drive through, the sounds of those blaring whistles, we ordered and got the day of driving started. Before we got to far down the road, I remember having a flashback of reading the kids that berenstain bear &lsquo;car trip&rsquo; story. Specifically that scene where the trees turn wild. That page, that image, has always been what this trip to mesa verde felt like in the outside tree lines as we made our way through the rocky mountains.</p>
<p>The woods grew taller and the roots seemed to strangle the soil beneath. As the SUV glided through the mountains, I really enjoyed the scenery. But more than that, watching the kids put down the whistles and look out the windows. I could see from the rear view mirror them staring out and I found myself happy at seeing them absorb the world. It was a quiet moment. That was until, because of my observations, I past an off ramp and had to figure out what we were going to do next.</p>
<p>Since if you haven&rsquo;t been in the rocky mountains, the coverage can be spotty at best. So the GPS had given out, and I got to figure out a new route. Time got away from me then, as I struggled to not say anything. While my wife, who has a key eye knew id messed up. It was about thirty minutes till we had started to get back on track and at that point the signs to Dinosaur Ridge had come into view. The problem being, that the detour id taken, had unfortunately meant we weren&rsquo;t going to be able to pull off and make it before they had closed for the day.</p>
<p>With a sigh, I remember driving to a small town. One that served ice cream. Pulling over, letting us all take a stretch. Filling up, and taking a moment enjoying the sunset.</p>
<p>I remember staring off and being happy.</p>
<p>It was nice to escape and get closer to the family. It&rsquo;st those little moments, like grabbing breakfast, missing a turn or losing your mind at kids abusing whistles.</p>
<p>Somehow, it all gets wrapped into a &rsquo;nice&rsquo; memory, with a little ice cream, offset with puffy clouds and an orange sunset.</p>

So I chose to, lol, go with Go along with the Colly framework for my scraping needs - and that decision has paid off in spades. Colly gave me the perfect balance of power and simplicity, allowing me to focus on what really mattered: getting the data.</p>
<p>So without further ado, lets go look over at github.com/bneil/mcp-go-colly</p>
<h1 id="peeking-under-the-hood-how-my-go-web-crawler-works">Peeking Under the Hood: How My Go Web Crawler Works</h1>
<p>So this project is fairly simple. We&rsquo;ve got three main pieces of code here: <code>main.go</code>, <code>mcp_integration.go</code>, and <code>crawler.go</code>.</p>
<p><code>main.go</code> is well the main loop of our app. It’s where everything kicks off. The first thing we are doing is integrate an MCP server. This server is what allows other systems or users to actually <em>use</em> my crawler tool.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// Create MCP server

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>It also creates the actual <code>crawlerTool</code> using code defined elsewhere, it tells the server <em>how</em> to handle requests coming into that tool. This involves a handler function that takes an incoming MCP request, figures out what URLs to crawl and how deep to go, calls our crawler logic, and then packages the results back up in the MCP format. Kinda like a receptionist taking a call, getting the details, passing the job to the right department, and then relaying the answer back.</p>
<p>Now, how does our code actually <em>talk</em> with MCP? <code>mcp_integration.go</code>, is the file about defining the language and structure needed to integrate with the MCP framework. It defines what a &ldquo;tool&rdquo; looks like in this world, including its name, description, and parameters.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>main.go</code> sets up the server and handles incoming requests.</li>
<li>It uses definitions from <code>mcp_integration.go</code> to understand the request and structure the response according to MCP rules.</li>
<li>It calls the actual crawling logic defined in <code>crawler.go</code>, passing the URLs and depth.</li>
<li><code>crawler.go</code> uses <code>colly</code> to fetch the data, handling configuration, success cases, and errors.</li>
<li>The results flow back up, get formatted, and sent out by the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope you enjoy the crawling! Also been listening to Dungeon Crawler Carl.. So idk, this seemed like a fun project.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">MCP Protocol</a> has been getting alot of traction online recently. I thought id take a stab at making my own mcp server. Given that one of the first things I ran into was context/memory between chat sessions with claude desktop (the mcp client im currently trying out) this article is about my adventures improving mcp memory.</p>
<p>So if your not familiar with the mcp memory server, you start a claude project, toss in the <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory">prompt</a> near the bottom, that sets up AI to call the mcp memory tool to see if the existing chat session was mentioned in the chat previously. Or add possibly relevant information to the chat.</p>
<p>So, beyond the initial move, there&rsquo;s been another interesting development! I was looking at how the &ldquo;mcp server&rdquo; interacts with data, and I found an interesting discussion on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/220">https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/220</a>. This issue highlighted some shortcomings of the existing mcp-memory when not supplying a json memory file.</p>
<p>Inspired by this and realizing that the initial flat file approach (and even just using simple JSON files) could quickly become unwieldy, especially with the potential for more complex data structures (I really don&rsquo;t know what the AI is going to start making without me giving examples) and concurrent access, I decided to take a slightly different path.</p>
<h3 id="forking-and-embracing-pouchdb">Forking and Embracing PouchDB</h3>
<p>Instead of just directly implementing CouchDB from scratch, I decided to build upon an existing effort. I forked the repository <code>https://github.com/BRO3886/mcp-memory-custom/</code>. This project was already exploring ways to manage data within the context of the MCP, and it seemed like a great starting point.</p>
<p>The original approach in the forked repository was still leaning towards in-memory storage or potentially simpler file-based JSON. However, I quickly realized that for a more scalable and robust solution, especially given the potential for multi-read scenarios from the &ldquo;mcp server,&rdquo; a more robust database was needed. Honestly thought about KeyDB and a few other ideas. I really wanted to find a sqlite but for redis, ie a lightning fast embedded db like good ol rocksdb, but its been so long since working with leveldb. But I digress.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where <strong>PouchDB</strong> came in. PouchDB is a JavaScript library that brings the power of CouchDB to the browser and Node.js. Importantly, it&rsquo;s designed to sync seamlessly with CouchDB. This made it a perfect fit for my needs, allowing me to leverage the familiar CouchDB document model and its benefits while potentially having the flexibility to run it in different environments if needed.</p>
<h3 id="why-pouchdb-over-pure-json-or-flat-files">Why PouchDB Over Pure JSON or Flat Files?</h3>
<p>When I was just loading up some d&amp;d characters I noticed that the knowledge graph in json was growing fairly large. Since this memory.json file is getting read in at every chat request, figured it was going to get large fast. soooo the limitations of simple JSON files or even a more basic in-memory storage /become clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Managing a large amount of data in flat JSON files can become slow and inefficient.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Handling multiple read/write operations on simple files without proper locking mechanisms can lead to data corruption or inconsistencies.</li>
<li><strong>Structure:</strong> While JSON is structured, managing complex relationships and querying data efficiently in a flat file structure can be challenging.</li>
</ul>
<p>PouchDB, being a CouchDB-compatible database, offers some pretty great advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document-Oriented:</strong> Data is stored as JSON documents, which is a natural fit for many types of data.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> PouchDB can easily sync with a CouchDB server, providing a robust backend for more persistent storage and easier sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Indexing and Querying:</strong> While not as feature-rich as a full-fledged CouchDB server in all aspects, PouchDB provides basic indexing and querying capabilities that are far superior to manually parsing JSON files.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> CouchDB and PouchDB have built-in mechanisms for handling conflicts during concurrent updates, ensuring data integrity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integrating-pouchdb">Integrating PouchDB</h3>
<p>The first step in our upgrade journey was to make some key changes to our codebase to use PouchDB instead of flat files:</p>

<p>Another benefit of using PouchDB is built-in document versioning through its revision system. This helps maintain data integrity and provides a foundation for potential future features like undo/redo or version history exploration.</p>
<p>The beauty of PouchDB is that it gives us the option to sync with a remote CouchDB instance in the future if we need more persistence or want to share the knowledge graph across different services. Since we&rsquo;re using the standard PouchDB API, this migration path is kept open without any code changes required in our core logic.</p>

This is particularly useful for new users who might not be familiar with how to structure their interactions with the memory system. Also it has the added benefit of me not seeing logs of meaningless errors in the Claude logs. Thanks to the everything mcp server which had some examples for me to follow because prompts/resources def don&rsquo;t feel as emulated as the tools do.</p>
<p>The resources list indicates that our memory system supports full CRUD operations plus search functionality, while the prompts list provides a default template that can guide AI models in effectively using the memory system. This approach makes our memory server more self-documenting and easier to integrate with various MCP clients.</p>
<h3 id="the-journey-continues">The Journey Continues</h3>
<p>By forking the <code>mcp-memory-custom</code> repository and integrating PouchDB, I&rsquo;m aiming for a more robust and scalable solution for managing the data related to my project (having more contextual conversations around op d&amp;d characters for baulders gate). So this move addresses the limitations of simple file-based storage and leverages the strengths of a document database, especially in the context of potential concurrent access as highlighted in the MCP server issue above.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in the process of fully integrating and testing this new approach, but I&rsquo;m optimistic that this will provide a much better foundation for managing my data going forward. And more importantly it seems to be working&hellip;</p>
<p>Still want to move some of the functionality out of the prompt itself and into the mcp server, but I can go into that on another day. Oh, and if you want to follow along check out: <a href="https://github.com/bneil/mcp-memory-pouchdb">mcp-memory-pouchdb</a></p>

<p>The days spent treking seemed laced with as much happiness as one could want. But the problem is many prisoners wanted more. It was that more that seemed to do them all in. Oof.</p>

<p>None really, I tried to think about what the mysteries of the land were. Im guessing it was a planet mid terraforming. I have no clue what the guards were about. But I can appreciate the adventure in the young protagonist and yeah. It was alot of a book.</p>

<p>I was imagining myself as an NPC getting wrecked every iteration. I couldn&rsquo;t fathom the amount of pain those attempts to correct the time stream would put the general populace through. Very fun thought experiment that can stay on paper.</p>
<p>All in all, really enjoyed the read.</p>
<h3 id="my-grips">My grips</h3>
<p>The ending had me a bit vexed. Like I said earlier, at the start of the story Barry is investigating a woman who is going to throw herself off a building due to FMS. However the ending has Barry going to the original timeline, which I think would have meant he would have gone at the first &rsquo;nose bleed&rsquo; that anyone in his direct knowledge would have known. What im saying is that how would Barry have the dead memory to go back to the original timeline, it was never mentioned that he was impacted from it. I guess if they had mentioned, &lsquo;oh and Barry a few months earlier had a nose bleed&rsquo;, I could have understood the ability, but as far as I could tell the only people with the original memories would have been those involved in the ION project.</p>
<p>That said, great book. 4/5</p>

</p>
<p>As a developer with close to twenty years of experience, I&rsquo;ve been asked to estimate work time and again. The primary method for estimation has been using Agile methodologies, which most in the tech industry understand all too well. You pick a t-shirt size, Fibonacci score, etc., to essentially say, &ldquo;This task is going to take an hour, a day, a week, or a few months.&rdquo; As I was writing about this subject on an email chain recently, I wanted to expand on it here. Namely, to answer the question: Is estimation bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Yes, they are bullshit. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not valuable bullshit.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss estimates outright. They are for project managers who, at the end of the day, are supposed to be protecting the team. The team needs to have some skin in the game, namely, some expert opinion on how long a task is going to take. So that the timeline can be communicated up the chain of command.</p>
<p>While this might seem very &ldquo;work 1.0,&rdquo; where you&rsquo;d have a factory line, and this newer work is more knowledge-based, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. At the end of the day, a project manager needs to be able to let organizations know how long an effort is going to take. But since this is my blog and I love diverting to Socratic self-dialogue, let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why? Why does it matter how long a thing takes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d say, it matters because someone is paying a premium for that &rsquo;thing&rsquo; to be created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exactly, so that &rsquo;thing&rsquo; needs to be tied to either a revenue-generating feature or a quality-of-life improvement.
So is that saying anything that doesn&rsquo;t give value back to the user is not worthwhile?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that depends on whether a feature creates novelty to attract attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So attention or revenue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, estimates are required because anything of value takes time. People need to eat, and an organization needs money to provide itself the time to grow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an ouroboros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h3 id="random-thought">Random Thought:</h3>
<p>Since Cory Doctorow won the word of the year award for &rsquo;enshitification&rsquo; <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/#kagi">from this article</a>, I&rsquo;d say that anything that gives value to the end user, as a developer or PM, should be aiming for. This relates to estimates as well, you should be aiming to do the most good for the most people on your platform, which means having a gist of an idea for how long something is going to take. Then implementing.</p>
<h3 id="back-on-target">Back on Target</h3>
<p>So, are estimates bullshit? Let&rsquo;s try and break it down pro and con.</p>
<p><strong>Pro</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are stating, given your professional judgment, how long a task should take.</li>
<li>You are not committing to anyone.</li>
<li>Things can and will go wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Con</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>It feels like you are committing to someone.</li>
<li>You are setting false expectations.</li>
<li>Things will go wrong, and then it&rsquo;s your fault.</li>
</ol>
<p>So again, this is mostly self-socratic thoughts, but I keep thinking about non-knowledge worker jobs. For example, you can get a new bathroom installed and have a contractor come over and estimate the amount of effort that it&rsquo;s going to take. Assuming they have done similar work, it&rsquo;s going to be around the same idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the job site.</li>
<li>Compare the parts/labor to the expected result.</li>
<li>Estimate and if things change, communicate with the stakeholder/client.</li>
</ol>
<p>People use contractors all the time, so using them in sprints shouldn&rsquo;t feel like bullshit. Since you are also working with diverse teams, it&rsquo;s not so much installing a new bathroom but installing a whole Willy Wonka factory sometimes. So you need to know when what features are going to drop.</p>
<p>However, are they bullshit? I still think so, but it&rsquo;s the same as deadlines. Things can happen, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t strive to meet them. They give you a north star or something to shoot for, and at the end of the day, in software engineering, isn&rsquo;t that a good thing?</p>

<p>To answer the age-old question: why would someone use a backend-as-a-service like PocketBase, Firebase or Supabase? Well, that was one of the questions I thought of when working at my last consulting gig. It turns out, it was nice to have all the toys in one box. It felt simple. Typically, I&rsquo;m used to building lots of functions to start building out functionality or quilting together a bunch of services in AWS/GCP to get things done. (Well firebase is GCP exclusive, but you get it) You see, building a backend from scratch can be a daunting task, especially for solo developers or small teams.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h3 id="on-firebase-pocket-base-etc">On firebase, pocket base, etc</h3>
<p>To answer the age-old question: why would someone use a backend-as-a-service like PocketBase, Firebase or Supabase? Well, that was one of the questions I thought of when working at my last consulting gig. It turns out, it was nice to have all the toys in one box. It felt simple. Typically, I&rsquo;m used to building lots of functions to start building out functionality or quilting together a bunch of services in AWS/GCP to get things done. (Well firebase is GCP exclusive, but you get it) You see, building a backend from scratch can be a daunting task, especially for solo developers or small teams.</p>
<p>So when building a new application, you don&rsquo;t want to spend time setting up a backend infrastructure. You want to get running quickly, test your ideas, and iterate on your product. Since your product is what matters at the end of the day. To that end, that&rsquo;s where a Pocketbase comes in - it gives you a pre-built backend that you can use as a foundation for your application.</p>
<p>Now&hellip;. the bells and whistles. I think it depends on the app you are building. For example, recently, I was building this silly game called <a href="https://emojihunt.fly.dev/">emojihunter</a>. I just needed to have some basic oauth options and I wanted to try out <a href="https://pocketbase.io/">pocketbase</a>. So for me big win was oauth, but Pocketbase does have some other fun wins. IE file storage, password reset emails, etc. If you do need an example of my auth lib I was creating, check out the note, <a href="https://bneil.me/notes/2024-11-27-pocketbase-client-golang/" title="About Us">Pocketbase Auth Client</a></p>
<p>But again, it depends on what you&rsquo;re building. The last gig I was doing, Firebase had a ton of features. Authentication (which you couldn&rsquo;t update the onboarding emails), storage via Firebase Storage, a database with Firebase Collections (which was one I was very excited to try out since it&rsquo;s known as a real time powerhouse), and on and on.</p>
<p>SO really working with Firebase made me want to do more with BaaS in general. Oh&hellip;</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the issue of scalability. If your app takes off, you don&rsquo;t want to be stuck with a backend that can&rsquo;t handle the traffic. With a BaaS, you can scale your backend to meet the demands of your growing user base, without having to lift a finger. Well, a little bit, mostly it would involve adding more money to the wallet and constantly measuring where in the application you could make improvements. For me, I usually try to add basic heuristics throughout the application to help figure those things out. But specifically with Firebase, I was shocked at how many options they had for looking through spend. Oh, and GCP functions were amazing with the app. Getting freebies from just hooking an <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable?gen=1st">HTTP Callable function</a>. If the person isn&rsquo;t authenticated they don&rsquo;t get access. Alright, back on course</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of using a BaaS is the real-time data syncing capabilities. Imagine being able to update your app in real time (like mentioned in Firebase collections), without having to worry about data consistency or latency. And with PocketBase, you even get offline support, which can be a win. Although I admit I haven&rsquo;t done much with that yet.</p>
<p>The only offering I have only tried a little less is Supabase, which I think, makes its main claim postgres vs Firebase collection which is noSQL and has a realllllly rough querying experince. Really need to build out some more things there, but figured id use the name to garner people into reading this article. So it must have worked. Cheers!</p>
<p>jk jk, honestly been fun trying out Pocketbase and enjoyed the Firebase experience. Even though, people have told me that the hockey stick with pricing for Firebase can get out of hand. I never experienced it. So I would recommend it if I was making something small in the future. Or just using pocketbase for something smaller.</p>

Today, as the day would have it, im going to be installing and trying out this language called &lsquo;Moonbit&rsquo;. The docs state, &lsquo;MoonBit is an end-to-end programming language toolchain for cloud and edge computing using WebAssembly&rsquo;. So that seems like an exciting thing to try out.</p>
<p>Installation was simple, they use this integration with vs code, following this link <a href="https://www.moonbitlang.com/download/">here</a> got me up and running fairly quickly.</p>
<p>After install, I used the command <code>moon new hello-moon</code>, which quickly made a new folder with all the stuffings. Here is the layout:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Running was also easy, just ran <code>moon run src/main</code>. Which resulted in an expected:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>➜ moon run src/main
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello, world!
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So now to dig into what the template had already created. It looks like the <code>src/main</code> has a main file. Which looks to be importing a hello library. So like that we already have some good examples of imports. Without having to immediatly resort to the documentation. Which for its maintainers, good job! Was happy to see the examples at <a href="https://moonbitlang.github.io/moon/">https://moonbitlang.github.io/moon/</a> which made the initial look into this language a breeze.</p>
<p>So to just putze around in the language a little. I always like to check out the structs and types and get an understanding of what thats about. So after some playing around I just got a loop and here is the output. Nothing much, but its something for a little but of work.</p>

<p>TL;DR If the purpose of AI is to become a programmers best friend, shouldn&rsquo;t we address a few issues in open source funding first?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was first coming up in programming, it was the early 90s. I was lucky and had the privilege to have a computer that was able to run a very early version of turbo linux red hat edition. I was even more lucky that I didn&rsquo;t cook the monitor I had. But that aside, programming was help files and programming was begging to find technical books because at the end of the day, you didn&rsquo;t have alot of resources to learn from. From my experience you had:</p>
<ul>
<li>BBS, Usenet, IRC, etc</li>
<li>Technical Books</li>
<li>Manual Files</li>
<li>Uncompiled procedural code</li>
</ul>
<p>So that was it for me. I basically spent all the money I could on shareware and technical books trying to guess what would make the most sense to learn. At the time I had a dual boot going. So I pinged between working in ms-dos batch files and trying to understand X11. Which as funny as that sounds now, I really do have a memory of being stuck in vim and having to shamefully reboot the computer because I didn&rsquo;t know the magic of <code>:q</code>. So before the nostalgia overtakes me, let me get to the point.</p>
<p>The barrier for entry in programming, was money.</p>
<p>It was a time when knowledge had a price and it was kept behind lock and key. What must seem a triviality now, I remember first buying &lsquo;Encarta&rsquo; and thinking, &lsquo;holy shit&rsquo;, im never need to go to the library again to cumbersomely read an encyclopedia. Which, to that point, id begged my parents for more than the letter &lsquo;M&rsquo; encyclopedia we owned. So that to me was MY first experience of the barrier coming down a little bit. Now, ill admit, this was only for general knowledge, not programming, but it was the first time people started copying and pasting sections of Encarta and using them in schools. I was in 7th grade at the time and have a memory of a kid getting caught using verbatim copy/paste encarta entries as a paper.</p>
<p>Now my own journey was also enriched during this time period because of the rise of the internet. I was there with Mosaic on windows 3.11, I was there when netscape first blazed to life with midi and animated gifs. Which for an aspiring developer was like a drug. But more than that, you could read any webpage by easily looking at the source code. It was intoxicating. This was a time of simple web editors, of geocities and it was the early internet. Which, to be honest I really never thought would catch on. It was so fun but it was super campy. It was a quilt of people and a snapshot of the early/mid nineties.</p>
<p>So for me, I began learning more javascript and html, just because it was easier to learn. The resources were a bit more accessible. So much like Encarta, the barrier to entry for web development was lower. Were there still pieces to serving html that were hard? Sure, CGI-Bin was still a foreign concept, php and asp were still fighting, as well as developing in perl (which would be a life long love).</p>
<p>Later, after the dot com burst and recovery. So early 2000s, I had landed my first technical job as a web developer, now in my twenties. The world was largely the same. I still had a pile of books in front of me. &lsquo;Javascript the good parts&rsquo;, &lsquo;Perl Cookbook&rsquo;, &lsquo;Unix/Linux Admin Manual&rsquo;, etc. My cubical resembled a modern day wizards tabernacle with all the dr. pepper cans hot glued to create a wizard staff. It was challenging because even though the books had the answers for most anything you wanted to build. I would still need to pour over them and decipher there secrets. Working with team members we eventually put together a really interesting animation library, we figured out how to normalize javascript between browsers and were making a go of it.</p>
<p style="padding:10px; text-align:center">
  <img class="thumbnail" src="https://bneil.me/images/mootools-payoff.png" height="150"  />
</p>
<p>Then, moo tools came out. Then, jquery came out. Things that took the work we had done and brought them into the forefront. Available to everyone. So in a moment, I got to watch a year of work and of some really great learning with coworkers get tossed away. I wasn&rsquo;t jealous, but I was sad, because I knew that open source technology could take away a problem that an organization would pay for. The company that paid for my time wasn&rsquo;t having to pay for jquery. So that was the first time I felt, kinda bad. It wasn&rsquo;t like my employer was paying the folks at jquery. I was the one having to relearn and my contributions were abysmal because at the time it was a world where (at least the orgs id been in) didn&rsquo;t contribute back.</p>
<p>Then, also, was the rise of Expert Exchange. Which was the first time outside of random forums/newsgroups, people started to congregate and solve common problems. I got there because I was trying to look up simple errors that would happen to apache, or weird javascript errors. But the thing was, the Exchange was behind a paywall. Well sure enough, a year or so later, Stack Overflow came in like an asteroid and with people helping people, or open sourcing the problem space. Experts Exchange went away and even more developers could be brought in to play. No longer did you &rsquo;need&rsquo; those large technical books. Mostly the documentation and stack overflow would be enough. I still found myself buying books. Hell, at one time I truly believed that if I had access to all the o&rsquo;reily books I could get any job in the industry.</p>
<p>So what im trying to say is, during my life as a developer ive seen the barrier to entry go down. From needing quite a lot of grit and expertise to hitting up google and searching.</p>
<p>Then of course, we had this massive increase in web frameworks after 2010, this was great in normalizing (think web2.0 but for front end ux experience) the front end space. This allowed for standardization in colleges and allowed code schools to start really getting the number of new programmers into the field. I think even president Obama had asked the american people to look into computer science. It was a lot of flooding of new talent into the industry for jobs that could actually met the cost of living. Which im sorry to say, is the hardest pill to swallow.</p>
<p style="padding:10px; text-align:center">
  <img class="thumbnail" src="https://bneil.me/images/ai-brain.png" height="150"  />
</p>
<p>So at this point, your probably wondering, what? this hasn&rsquo;t been a rant on AI. Where is the AI bashing.</p>
<p>Well, its here and its not. AI as ive used it so far, which is just the beginning, can do some basic programming tasks. However as of this date, using claude, chatgpt, and gemini - hasn&rsquo;t resulted in very much &lsquo;good&rsquo; code. Its mostly sloppy and it doesn&rsquo;t know what its talking about. However, its taking that barrier to entry for anyone non technical and moved the bar. Making it seem like you can get away with a much smaller work force.</p>
<p>AI lies impressively and the prompts ive seen are very good at creating error filled code with a lot of confidence.</p>
<p>Its kinda terrible.</p>
<p>But it does have me asking. Whats the end goal for this technology? If it does succeed and someday has the singularity of experience of a developer. What happens to me? Is it like the lamp lighters of the early 1900s. What happens to all those people who went through code schools who are chasing a cost of living?</p>
<p>There are so many societal considerations to take into account and things id love to see &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; or even some open questions addressed</p>
<ol>
<li>Is open source fundamentally ruined because it doesn&rsquo;t address monetary concerns of contributors</li>
<li>Why can&rsquo;t people that provide value to the world get more of the capital</li>
<li>Why do things that intrinsically benefit society get the least amount of capital</li>
<li>How do AI companies create benefits for open source? LLM&rsquo;s learned from them shouldn&rsquo;t it pay that back?</li>
</ol>
<p>I personally am thinking those over but wanted to get them on paper first because its interesting how often they seem to bubble up in conversation.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<h2 id="reaching-out-but-hitting-dead-ends">Reaching Out but Hitting Dead Ends</h2>
<p>This week in trying to drum up work, I&rsquo;ve been focused on expanding my client base. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a rollercoaster ride - some promising leads, but a lot of dead ends as well.</p>
<p>Early in the week, I reached out to a few companies I thought could really benefit from my technical expertise. Had a great initial call with the CEO of a fintech startup, and they seemed really interested in working with me. We discussed their pain points in depth and I outlined how our team could help streamline their engineering processes and infrastructure. But after following up multiple times, I haven&rsquo;t heard back. It&rsquo;s frustrating when you feel like you&rsquo;ve made a real connection, only to have the trail go cold.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience with a retail company exploring a major digital transformation. The VP of IT was enthusiastic about my capabilities and we had a productive brainstorming session. They were looking to increase the use of Terraform but when it came time to get a proposal together, all communication suddenly stopped. I&rsquo;m not sure if budget constraints, a change in leadership, or just general inertia got in the way, but it&rsquo;s disheartening to put in that initial effort only to have the opportunity slip away.</p>
<h2 id="searching-for-a-full-time-role">Searching for a Full-Time Role</h2>
<p>In addition to my fractional CTO work, I&rsquo;ve also been actively searching for a full-time CTO position. I&rsquo;ve applied to a number of promising openings, and have had some encouraging initial conversations. However, I&rsquo;m finding that the interview process can be quite drawn out, with multiple rounds of discussions and assessments.</p>
<p>I recently made it through to the final stages for a solutions architect role at a promising AI startup, only to be told that they&rsquo;ve decided to postpone the hire indefinitely due to funding uncertainty. It was disappointing, but a good reminder that these kinds of decisions can be out of my control.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Through these setbacks, I&rsquo;ve learned that persistence are key. Just because an opportunity didn&rsquo;t pan out doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s dead forever. I&rsquo;m making a note to follow up with those leads again in a few months - priorities and decision-makers can shift quickly in the startup world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also realized the importance of networking and referrals. Many of my most fruitful client relationships have come through warm introductions from existing contacts. So I&rsquo;m redoubling my efforts to expand my professional network. So we&rsquo;ll see how that goes next week.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it&rsquo;s been a challenging week, but I know these kinds of setbacks are all part of the job. Onward and upward.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used the context package alot with basically little thought, so I figured it would be helpful to have a few notes on the use and reason behind it for later reference. So hopefully this can help future devs and myself later on if I forget.</p>
<p>The way I remember context, is that its a wrapper around information you want to pass all around your program. You have special switches to kill the context and forget it ever existed. But really its a way to keep &lsquo;context&rsquo; of an action or series of actions.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p style="text-align:center">

<p>It works like a jukebox, where wg.Add to adds a new song and once your your songs over you say wg.Done (usually done in a defer). To play another song you do the same thing.
Once all songs are done, the code beneath wg.Wait, will be run. Usually, this is done at the end of program unless your creating some interesting state machine. But lets look at the example</p>

<p>This took me awhile to grasp, so the easiest example I could think of is just launching an isolated go routine and showing how to kill it manually. Think of like timeboxing an activity, you want to make sure that the go routine will run forever so your

<p>oh one more note, you may see context.TODO rather than context.Background in your adventures. Don&rsquo;t Panic.
Its &lsquo;basically&rsquo; the same thing as background except its meant to be temporary. Where background is there for the long haul, todo, is more placeholder in nature
So it can be indicitive of a test or just a placeholder.</p>

<h2 id="trusting-your-gut-the-key-to-fulfilling-work">Trusting Your Gut: The Key to Fulfilling Work</h2>
<p><em>or how to stop attending meetings that make you feel sick</em></p>
<p>Have you ever found yourself dreading a meeting, only to leave it feeling completely drained and uninspired? I&rsquo;ve been there, and it&rsquo;s not a pleasant experience. In fact, it&rsquo;s one of the main reasons I recently stepped down from my last role.</p>
<p>Working in an environment with an endless stream of mandatory meetings was slowly sucking the life out of me. I would get this terrible feeling of anxiety and existential dread leading up to these gatherings, and no matter how much I tried to rationalize it, I just couldn&rsquo;t shake the belief that they weren&rsquo;t serving me or the company well.</p>
<p>The thing is, I&rsquo;m someone who derives a deep sense of purpose and fulfillment from the work I put in, not just from attending endless meetings. And while my coworkers would insist that &ldquo;meetings are work,&rdquo; I could never fully convince myself of that. In my gut, I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
<p>So when I started feeling that same knot in my stomach while working with certain consulting clients, I knew I had to make a change. I realized that I needed to start trusting my instincts and setting better boundaries - even if it meant cutting ties with a client sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s the thing: that gut feeling, that intuitive sense of unease, is often trying to tell us something important. It&rsquo;s a signal that the situation at hand may not be aligned with our values, our strengths, or our overall well-being. And when we ignore those signals, we end up feeling drained, anxious, and resentful.</p>
<p>But when we listen to our gut and make decisions accordingly, something magical happens. We start to feel more invigorated, more inspired, and more fulfilled in our work. We&rsquo;re able to pour our energy into the things that truly matter, rather than wasting it on meetings and tasks that leave us feeling empty.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone who constantly finds yourself dreading certain work obligations, I&rsquo;d encourage you to pause and really tune in to that gut feeling. What is it trying to tell you? Is this situation truly serving you, or is it time to set some boundaries and make a change?</p>
<p>It may feel uncomfortable at first, but I can assure you that the payoff is well worth it. By trusting your intuition and aligning your work with what energizes you, you&rsquo;ll not only be more productive and effective, but you&rsquo;ll also experience a newfound sense of joy and purpose in what you do.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t that what we all want, at the end of the day?</p>

<p>The last month, April 2024, has been a sobering time of calling friends, reaching out, networking,
and generally trying to find some space and some security. While not all of my endeavours were successful, with the help of a friend, was able to get some groundwork laid for staying afloat. So since, I do have a bit of a break, I thought Id reflect and write down my thoughts. Just some observations, really, from the last few years.</p>
<p>So, to start, I don&rsquo;t blame anyone. I believe most people work and act to the achieve the best results for themselves and for the projects they care the most about. In fact, its how I usually try and find folks to  work with. I find the people like me, care alot about technology and getting things done. Who care a lot about people and want to create a humane place to get that work done.</p>
<p>To that end, working with my old startup was on point. People cared, we only ever lost a team member to our  culture, once, and that is out of seven years. Which, to me is a great win.</p>
<p>Now no startup is perfect, some things I have been thinking about on reflection were:</p>
<ol>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t have a north star for what we built, even three years in you couldn&rsquo;t figure out what we did well. Whenever we did find that tagline or phrase, it changed.</li>
<li>The whole of the organization didn&rsquo;t have a hierarchy.</li>
<li>The sales pipeline was a mess, top of funnel was never a priority.</li>
<li>The company was losing money on the team, which is what we expected in a VC backed startup, but it was a death sentence.</li>
<li>The CEO directly made commitments that other c-level suite folks disagreed with and weren&rsquo;t aware of until they were promised. You haven&rsquo;t felt more powerless until you hear what you&rsquo;re on the hook for.</li>
<li>Too many pointless meetings</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, im <strong>not</strong> here to air out my dirty laundry from the past seven years and im certainly not going to do it from my own one sided point of view. I just want to discuss those points on their own merits and explain how I think they helped put the startup on the back foot. <em>Also, I just want it out of my head</em>. So let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>
<h3 id="the-company-tagline">The company tagline</h3>
<p>Just do it. Nike</p>
<p>Think big. IMAX</p>
<p>Belong anywhere. Airbnb</p>
<p>For us,</p>
<p>Widgets are the bottleneck for your companies growth&hellip; We are &rsquo;the&rsquo; Widget hub&hellip; We focus on getting Widgets done faster.</p>
<p>I realize that comparing yourself to Nike, IMAX, etc is not what you do as a startup. You find your fit. I&rsquo;ve often heard it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you pivot 100 times or stick to a single plan and execute. At the end of the day your only comparing lottery tickets. Those tickets can look vastly different depending on the leadership. But I have a problem with not being able to solidify a goal after three years. I need to have something I can look to, to turn to,  to understand vision when no one is around. When im trying to figure out the most important next step for engineering. I look left, look right and look in. Taking those internal mantra&rsquo;s and making them material.</p>
<p>So is it the most important, no. But it helps keep all departments rowing the same direction. Something we really needed every day, it was missing.</p>
<p>To that end, I think what I could have done better here, was in shepherding the consensus and driving it home with investors. If we believe that our special sauce is X, then the board should agree so they don&rsquo;t have any surprises. I think half the time what we spoke about internally was in stark difference towards the expectations of others. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t the CTO&rsquo;s duty, I should have made more of an effort to hold the management group to consensus. Because that&rsquo;s our job, brand the message.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-structure">Organizational structure</h3>
<p>So I think this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-software-product-democracy-jose-r-gorchs/">article</a> from Jose Gorch, did a fantastic job in outlining the issues I saw with the flat structure. Now mind you, thats just how folks work in engineering. We hold ourselves to the things we know best and trust product to do what they do best. So in essence by trusting each other, we naturally achieve great things. However, this can breakdown. It does so when the people creating the product are second and third guessed by upper management. That means, to be clear, you either hire someone as a product manager and let them deliver what your vision to the best of their ability. Or you do it, and admit you aren&rsquo;t clear enough to make that vision come into fruition.</p>
<p>It was painful for this lesson in particular. To see the inability for one team member to express, given all the process we put in place, to be successful. To time and time again hear, we didn&rsquo;t deliver on the promises we made. That gutted me and it gutted the team and it really rubbed me raw because the only thing in life we have is time. Wasting it is a travesty, mostly for me. But also because I/we could have focused on something better.</p>
<p>So is this about org structure, kinda. Its about communicating as an org, but its about leadership and what happens when that fails. I think flat orgs can work. But I don&rsquo;t think it works when the people involved don&rsquo;t understand the bottom line. If it&rsquo;s not clear from either top or bottom, you build the wrong thing. Thats the failure.</p>
<p>So I think this one was more of a lesson learned. Should have pumped the breaks on the consensus and gave people roles and expectations from day one. Namely that the upper management runs the show and that we are responsible if the company sinks. So setting expectations with the team, day one, on what happens when we miss goals and releases. We did &ldquo;try&rdquo; this a few times, but should have been consistent in holding people accountable to their KPI&rsquo;s. Like that should have been <em>the</em> measure and we didn&rsquo;t keep it consistent.</p>
<h3 id="on-using-vc-money">On using VC Money</h3>
<p>One of the key things I&rsquo;ve learned over the years is that losing money on a team is often par for the course, especially in the early stages of a VC-backed startups. In fact, it&rsquo;s typically a sign that the founders are investing heavily in building out their core operations and infrastructure.  However, when that loss starts to become a &ldquo;death sentence&rdquo; for the company, that&rsquo;s a red flag that needs to be addressed quickly. As CTO, I found it incredibly hard to see the runway shrinking and literally doing everything I could to keep the team aligned on where I believed we could strike out for the most value.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, revenue is what drives growth. So as a CTO watching burn rate and cash reserves became a think I was looking at everyday. The big thing for me, that I felt I did well was regardless of those financial challenges, I kept the focus on delivering value to our customers. Made sure that the things we were building and promising were tracked and that we communicated to the org why we were doing the things we were doing.</p>
<p>It really feels like a catch-22. When you have a vc backed company, you expect the vc&rsquo;s to bail you out. But if you can&rsquo;t float or show more growth in the industry, they aren&rsquo;t going to toss you a life raft. So the real lesson learned for me, was just slower growth. Because no amount of sweat can make other departments more effective. Given enough time, things can work out, but at a startup money is the only measure of success.</p>
<h3 id="sales">Sales</h3>
<p>If building software is the core of your business, then revenue is the lifeblood that keeps it running. Sales are the champions who move that revenue into your company&rsquo;s coffers. They may be the single most important factor in keeping the lights on and things moving forward. This is a critical point - growing too fast without a solid sales strategy can be the downfall of a startup.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect sales to just magically happen. You need to know how to effectively sell your product, who the right sales folks are, and a repeatable sales process to hand off to new hires. Your sales strategy shouldn&rsquo;t rely on 100% enterprise or corporate deals either - it needs to be multi-faceted to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>As the CTO, I should have been more involved in the sales process early on. Spending too much time gathering feedback from peripheral team members, while valuable, doesn&rsquo;t directly impact the bottom line. Being more hands-on with sales calls and even taking on a client or two myself would have given me better insight and allowed me to provide more informed guidance. Even if I wasn&rsquo;t driving sales, just observing and offering a technical perspective would have been hugely beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="surprises-during-all-hands">Surprises during all-hands</h3>
<p>Again, this one is another no brainer. Your c-level suite, needs to be involved in all the debate. Got it? Great. Now, what do you do after spending 3+ hours in a meeting pitching devils advocate. Finding consensus, going back to the drawing board, etc etc. What you don&rsquo;t do is take all that strategy and throw it out the window the first chance you get.</p>
<p>As the face for the company.  You don&rsquo;t hit all the points your c-suite told you not to. You don&rsquo;t &lsquo;read the room&rsquo; and tell them them anyway.</p>
<p>Because people listen to you as leadership.</p>
<p>They hold you higher for what you say than a co-worker.</p>
<p>Things shouldn&rsquo;t surprise your co-founders or your c-suite. They should all be up on the table and discussed. Because at the end of the day, its a team effort that keeps employee&rsquo;s around. If your making promises that I know don&rsquo;t match revenue, it is a problem. Even if you &lsquo;believe&rsquo; the money will materialize, its not an ethical place to steer from. Tell people, that we are doing everything but don&rsquo;t make promises.</p>
<p>So I should have quit. I should have recognized that this was a pattern and quit. I don&rsquo;t think you can come back from this breach of trust, I just don&rsquo;t. If you don&rsquo;t want to be made to be blamed for what someone is saying then you can&rsquo;t remain complicit after they have said it. It was no ones fault but my own, and of course a fear of losing my job when countless times I heard things that didn&rsquo;t align with what I knew to be true at the company. Whether that was to staff or to anyone. Its my own responsibility to be accountable when anyone says things that I don&rsquo;t agree with. So, it was a big red flag. Because at the end of the day, if a person knowingly continues to say things that are in disagreement with what you agree to say or do. Then its just them being them and you should do you.</p>
<h3 id="pointless-meetings">Pointless meetings</h3>
<p>I could write a novel on the amount of meetings that could have been an email. It&rsquo;s a trope at this point. But for some reason, they got so much worse near the end. Just the same meeting really.
A rehashing of the same dried leaves . Doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times you look. The writing is on the wall. So why are we having this meeting?</p>
<p>A good friend once told me that, meetings are working. They are worth looking into the camera, taking physical notes, and listening proactively. To engage in the meeting, because it&rsquo;s important. So
you know, I really liked that. For someone who, for years, didn&rsquo;t pay attention that much in meetings, I did. Which wasn&rsquo;t a light switch but it was good practice. To just keep my fingers off the
keyboard and try to paraphrase what the speaker is saying. Repeat it back and ask questions, even if they seem dumb, it never felt like the team made it out like I was saying something done. So if
nothing else, I really appreciated the idea, of not treating meetings like baggage but like something that is a formality of doing deep work.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t waste that time on pointless rehashing, you spend it with your team figuring out how to make hay into gold.</p>
<p>So thinking more about this, I think going forward, I will be more consistent in keeping an agenda, keeping people engaged through active participation, and really get better at treating a meeting like work. For more redundant conversations, I should have taken the time to bang the gavel, take stock of what was said, and figure out if we were just kicking the can. If we are, take those steps to re-focus the meeting and if not, embrace the new. So really, it&rsquo;s all about agency in those meetings, finding my own voice, and being consistent in using it to drive work forward.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>So, just to reiterate, I had a lot of fun in my last adventure. Looking for new ones all the time. Feeling a bit older now and feeling like I know better how to act professionally when the world around me isn&rsquo;t. How my strengths in listening, and in empathizing with people are getting stronger. But also realizing, that it takes adventures like the one ive had to become a more rounded person. So the bullets I wrote out definitely weren&rsquo;t all my learnings, but I felt that writing those thoughts up would be better served out of me then in. So in the end, hope you enjoyed the read and if you find one of those bullets that resonates with you leave a comment. Or just bookmark.</p>
<p>Take from this what makes you stronger and leave behind anything doesn&rsquo;t serve you anymore.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>Got started on this book from a recommendation from my wife and wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. Devil in the white city by Erik Larson
goes into two pivotal events of the early
twentieth century in Chicago. One is the creation to execution of the 1893 worlds fair and the other being the serial killings of H. H. Holmes. The two events intertwine
during the creation, dedication and closure of the worlds fair. A fascinating read and while the horrific murders performed by Holmes
work as a shadow to the work done to create that spectacle. It touched me and the individual accounts of the fair were just
an amazing process to go through with the authors masterful help.</p>
<p>To speak to that darker shade from the book, Holmes, the way he comes off is just so self serving. Its hard to understand the mind of a serial killer. The idea that
this person is just compartmentalized the hurt of someone else into either a sexual or primal need is impossible to empathize with. As I read, it was
almost a constant game to him, the stealing and repetitive lying - that even after he was caught it seemed like it was just more about how the world
had misunderstood the situation. It was telling in the final chapters to hear about the regret from his jailors and just how much empathy he inspired in people.</p>
<p>It was and is a chilling take away for me.</p>
<p>The other standout was the varied cast of characters that Erik wrote about. Each having their own motivations to create a feat greater than that of the worlds fair which had unveiled the Eiffel tower. It was American pride and more than that, it was a time when places like Chicago wanted to create a place that could capture the imagination of a generation. The scenes in which we find ourselves seeing a young walt disney or the first wrigleys chewing gum.
Just felt magical, like witnessing the seeds of small aspects of American culture first coming into place.</p>
<p>What else can I say. If you have ever wanted to hear real life stories of people in the 1890&rsquo;s, a time where cars weren&rsquo;t a thing. Where people were easily
missed and it was common place to accidentally die by trolly its a wild ride. Mix that with the audacious killings that Holmes performs and you
get a very vivid tale. Def made me look up pictures of the world fair and next time im in Chicago, id like to see if that little island is still around.</p>

<p>Doing thirty days of blog posts was a lot harder than I thought. The last couple days especially felt difficult, since I didn&rsquo;t have time to continue coding up any htmx examples or alpinejs or really much golang. Since, typically for those projects I spend a few hours coding and writing the steps back to the blog. But even more, finding things that I wanted to write about was difficult. So I&rsquo;m really glad that this is over and im happy that I tried.</p>
<p>Not going to lie. I did end up missing a few times through this month, id usually just have half an article written, or some terrible idea have baked that I just couldn&rsquo;t <code>git push</code> on. But end of it, I did finish writing all the articles and I did really enjoy the experience. But maybe a quick breakdown is in order</p>
<h2 id="what-i-liked-about-the-experience">What I liked about the experience</h2>
<ol>
<li>Blogging! I got to throw all sorts of spaghetti at this blog in terms of subjects</li>
<li>It was fun, stressful but fun</li>
<li>I got to improve the blog a little bit by upgrading themes and staying up to date</li>
<li>Made me appreciate my weekly writeup more, since that was an easier post</li>
<li>Forgiving myself when I missed a day. I&rsquo;m only human and these kinda challenges really remind you of that.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-i-didnt-like">What I didn&rsquo;t like</h2>
<ol>
<li>My spelling. Without doing more revisions, my usual bad spelling has infected the internet&hellip; maybe vscode has a more aggressive spell checker?</li>
<li>Forgetting a day, or forgetting to push up an article.</li>
<li>Not having a bucket of drafts to use for articles. I ran through ideas fairly fast and maybe thats not even bad?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Going to do this again next year and am going to again attempt the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">advent of code</a> coming out in a few hours. Maybe this year ill be able to get passed the fourth or fifth day. That challege wrecks me once it gets into matrix arrays and the like. But, here is hoping.</p>
<p>Oh, and thanks, if anyone reads this, hope you got some enjoyment out of the articles posted!</p>

<p>Over the years, ive slowly been working on what I see as the pedigree of a technical CTO. Which, as ive been told, in person and online isn&rsquo;t what the job is supposed to be. The CTO is a leadership position and that if you are coding you are doing things &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;. While I don&rsquo;t disagree, as the amount of planning, meetings and ancillary discussions have overwhelmed my work life. I would posit that a technical CTO is still valuable as an engineering resource. But why?</p>
<h3 id="most-likely-your-technical-cto-has-been-through-the-gauntlet">Most likely your technical CTO has been through the gauntlet</h3>
<p>Maybe this isn&rsquo;t you, but maybe it is. You&rsquo;ve survived SOAP, Test driven development and a myriad of different challenges through your career and have come out the other side. Now, you sit in a meeting listening to the same tabs vs spaces conversations and its bland but you know what. You, probably, at one time cared and can provide a final directive. Even if that is that its a silly conversation and that we already have a style guide to direct the conversation.</p>
<p>But you have someone who you can relay on to keep these conversations from impacting the work and the bottom line of the organization.</p>
<h3 id="most-likely-your-technical-cto-knows-infrastructure">Most likely your technical CTO knows infrastructure</h3>
<p>Almost similarly to my first point. The technical CTO is going to have some ideas on IaC or getting the right island to start building your product/hut on. The engineering side of them are going to understand pricing across different PaaS offerings. They are going to know what happens when you adopt k8s to early and scaling. Its easier to get it right when you do it early in the process. Which also reminds me of</p>
<h3 id="technical-cto-understand-application-development">technical CTO understand application development</h3>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t going to have the &lsquo;force&rsquo; used on them when they see a slow app. Or let the fact you have no observability into your application. Or all the lovely day 2 operations work that the team hasn&rsquo;t deemed necessary. Well, as a technical CTO, you can just add that. You can go into the codebase an instrument. This doesn&rsquo;t mean your are an SRE, or a developer, you just know that its what you need to have confidence in your application on production</p>
<h3 id="so-much-more">so much more</h3>
<p>As a person who has spent a huge chunk of their career trying out different hats across engineering organizations, I love being a technical CTO. Its been hard as teams grow to actually do less and lead more. I miss the dopamine hit of finishing bugs and I enjoy getting into the weeds on a problem. But does mean im an impediment to my team. I don&rsquo;t think so, I look at the backlog, far down the line and work to find incredible hard problems that don&rsquo;t need solving right now and start cracking at them over time.</p>
<p>I love that I can sometimes put six months of effort into an issue thats moves our little product a little further. Its what you should do as a technical leader. You don&rsquo;t have to lose all those skills you&rsquo;ve built towards, you can still IC and lead. I personally don&rsquo;t believe them to be mutually exclusive.</p>

<ol>
<li>Frieren: Beyond Journey&rsquo;s End</li>
<li>Shangri-La Frontier</li>
<li>Jujutsu Kaisen</li>
<li>The Kindgoms of Ruin</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking the lead is Frieren, just because the artwork and story both are a treat to watch. The pace reminds me of Berserk and I like that the unfolding of the characters is taking awhile.

<p>Taking the lead is Frieren, just because the artwork and story both are a treat to watch. The pace reminds me of Berserk and I like that the unfolding of the characters is taking awhile. Its almost relaxing to watch and like I said, the animation is beautiful.</p>
<p>Second, Shangri-La is a fantastic SOA style plot, with a fun dark souls twist. Its a fun watch and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed EldenRing esk main character.</p>
<p>Third, Jujutsu Kaisen, its like Demon Slayer in the way the action screams off the screen. The only reason its down this far was due to my own bad taste.</p>
<p>Fourth, The kingdoms of ruin. This one was a shock for me, again, I think Berserk changed my life. The first episode was so good in how disturbing it was that I had to include it here. I have felt that the story is kinda falling a little after the third episode due to the plot and characters taking interesting choices. But either way the animation and the world is interesting and id love to read the manga at some point.</p>

Its one of the few things that I have been able to keep up since last October. For me it was a way to get through some of the harsher realities of the startup and time doing its thing. A usual entry starts with the date and day of the week. Followed by temperature and type of day, ie cloudy, windy, amazing. Then a quick jot of what I got up to that day. Then I allow for a section of just dumping, usually thats more rare but its nice to have the space. Finally I write one thing im grateful for, which has helped keep up with gratitude in general.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I journal every day. Its one of the few things that I have been able to keep up since last October. For me it was a way to get through some of the harsher realities of the startup and time doing its thing. A usual entry starts with the date and day of the week. Followed by temperature and type of day, ie cloudy, windy, amazing. Then a quick jot of what I got up to that day. Then I allow for a section of just dumping, usually thats more rare but its nice to have the space. Finally I write one thing im grateful for, which has helped keep up with gratitude in general.</p>
<p>Recently I was able to get past a year of entries, which felt amazing. The biggest benefit has been the ability to spin back the year and see those entries matching the day. Which to be honest, has been both heart breaking and thought provoking. Heart breaking in that it was just a really hard time and thought provoking because even in the situation I was in, im here now. Still making entries, still trying to be a better dad and a better CTO.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for some random internet person telling you some advice. Start a journal and check-in with yourself. Tell some story or event that happened today. In a year, I bet you&rsquo;ll be suprised at what you wrote and how far you&rsquo;ve come.</p>

Viola Davis was especially good, I liked the fact she was playing the original game master.

If they ever end up showing a few of just the competitions through time (which i realize is not the point of the movies) - it would be great.

<p>What is it about technology like the command line that is so good? For me its nostalgia and its familiar. I love magic of the command line, the way the blinking cursor is just waiting for me or anyone to take it for a spin.

<p>Every week has its own struggles. This week it was alot of peaks and valleys. Im glad to have gotten through those valleys but this week was definitely a week where I learned about the importance of timing. When to interject and to interject. Its been a hard lesson for me since I&rsquo;ve spent so many years head down and focused on creating things an an independent contributor. Now that ive got more of a voice, exercising it when the time is right, is important. So im thankful for the people this week that did speak up when it was important to do so. It humbles me and makes me proud to work with the people I do. So going forward, im going to do more, even if its just small to start.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

So its always good to have your tasks in there.</p>

While also throwing some docker into the mix as well, because why not. Im trying to reflect on basically ten years of technologies in those spaces between 2010 and 2020. Then trying laying out what my perceptions of that technology was from a person that truly wants to have optimal efficiency and security taken into account for their underlying application run time environments. So really this is a continuation of just that, where do we run an application and how is it better than another platform.</p>
<p>So lets just start there, where can you run unikernels in production:</p>
<p>Public Cloud Providers like GCP or AWS, using something like <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/unik">Unik</a> or using nanovms via <a href="https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/deploying-nanos-node-js-unikernels-to-aws">ops.city</a>.</p>
<p>then for wasm, you can run those in production</p>
<p>Using WASI, you can launch wasm server side tech on lambda, but so far its been lack luster since its tied directly to node.js rather then having its own dedicated runtime. Other implementations I looked at were <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/">wasmCloud</a> and seeing if that could be used in aws. This was a mixed bag since in 2022 the runtime for lambda was set to read only. In anycase, I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to launch a k8s cluster with wasmCloud, but hopefully ill get some credits to try that later this year.</p>
<p>wasmtime / wasmer also look like ways to run this stuff on gcp/aws. Again, haven&rsquo;t had a chance yet, but really looking into these as way to run wasm a an api/server kinda setup.
Also haven&rsquo;t tried out wasmer edge, which ive been really wanting to as well, since it looks like a fast way to get up and running to do this.</p>
<p>alright, well, its like the quote says, if you can do something in under two minutes just do it!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep trying and report back if I can deploy something on wasmer edge, because it would be very neat and I have a few projects over at vercel that would be great to move onto a wasm platform.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>I think I could do a better job at explaining the reasoning behind why you would want to actually use this technology as well as examples of how to deploy these technologies. So I may just start doing that in upcoming blogs since I feel that the number of topics is a bit to nuanced.</p>
<p>So, at a high level, unikernels are great and wasm is great and both kinda give similar benefits. While, I still think these are worth while techologies, at least for me, im still learning how to make the best use of these pieces of tech and need to carve out more time to write these things up.</p>
<p>So I will work towards writing more of that in this blog going forward.</p>

Even when VM&rsquo;s (virtual machines) became popular, its always been a fascinating way to carve out a box and serve applications securely. To that end, unikernel technology has been around for a long time, I believe around that 2k date. Its something that I have picked up and put down but thought id speak a little of it here</p>
<p>For me the first time i was introduced to unikernels was this website promoting LING (unfortunately they are no longer around), which was an implementation using erlang to create a unikernel that was set as an on demand instance of a website. So basically, you load a website, the website creates an instance of a unikernel serves a page and then that unikernel destroys itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://bneil.me/images/erlang-on-zen.png" alt="LING" title="Snapshot when LING was around"></p>
<p>I quickly went down the route of getting this kind of setup going, because the idea of a stateless website seemed really secure and possibly cost efficient. Think of on demand instances rather then long running VM&rsquo;s. Not running a server until the moment a request comes in is magic.</p>
<p>But to take a step back, when looking at unikernels I was trying to find a way satisfy resource efficiency. I&rsquo;m cheap. I like running my applications on only the most necessary components to run an application. That along with security, I love the minimal attack surface that unikenerals provide.</p>
<p>Kinda funny, at one time this website was running on a unikernel, based off the work at <a href="https://ops.city/">OpsCity</a>. At the time this blog was on Vultr, but I actually found my own requirement for this blog was underselling the overengineering I was doing to deploy things. Good on the folks at ops city, they were super helpful in me setting those things up a few years back.</p>
<p>As ive moved on, well not really, I&rsquo;ve been following the conversation around wasm which seems to share alot of the same goals as using unikernels, namely, resource optimzation and security via sandbox. Even docker to some extent. As unikernels achieve this on a OS level, wasm achieves this through different means, as a straight binary executable that you can serve via a server like nginx or invoked via node, apache, etc. Again, kinda similar to Docker except that its not run through a hypervisor.</p>
<p>Think I may have bit off more than I can chew on this topic, so I might just use the next blog entry to keep distilling my thoughts. Till Next time</p>

Feels much better than last year although most of that is just illusion. Its a startup so almost anything can happen in a flash. Which is good and terrifying, which I enjoy.</p>
<p>Its been a very frugal week. But nothing to be done about it. Sometimes unexpected expenditures come up and im happy we had the money to fix things, but its not a great feeling getting to that next paycheck.</p>
<p>In happier news we actually shared the movie &lsquo;Problem Child&rsquo; with the kids - Forgot that John Ritter was in that! So a little popcorn and a movie saved the day again. Or at least, the kids were exploding with laughter at some parts. Which was worth it.</p>

I think ive mentioned it in my other note articles on this blog but it really is a cornerstone of my daily routine. Well that is until a meeting happens. So this is more of a quick article on how to continue using a pomodora even with some or many meetings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Turn it off
Yes, you&rsquo;ve given up, the meeting is more important than your special little technique. Its a strategy that ive used, but unfortuantly, I forget. I forget to start up the timer again after my meetings have completed. So for me this is just a non starter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let it run
Does your pomodora have a bell? Welp, then if you do the 25/5 strategy I use, you are going to hear about it at least once throughout the meeting. Which is fine, its another reason to keep those zoom microphones silenced. But its also just better practice to modify the timer to something like 60/15. Which, you&rsquo;ll notice doesn&rsquo;t work great if you have a cluster of meetings back to back. However, this brings up the larger problem of meetings</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Who the fuck said, in this remote world, that meeting after meeting needs to start right on the hour. Its rediculas. I was in a cluster of meetings last week and I couldnt believe how odd it was to virtually hussle from room to room. I don&rsquo;t even remember it being this bad when I was working hybrid or in the office full time. Just feels like people expect you at the meeting regardless of what meetings you&rsquo;ve been to previously. End tirade</p>
<p>Ok, so a little off track today. What I was trying to suggest at the end of things is that if you want to try and use a pomodora while also listening in meetings, just set it up to hourly and use five minutes after a meeting to condense notes or go to the bathroom. Use those five minutes for you and the next meeting be damned. I don&rsquo;t know if thats popular or born from my own inate privledge or maybe its a weird thing to be an animal forced to sit in place and listen to other animals endlessly. I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know that once the meetings end and its back to solving a problem.</p>
<p>Pomodoras do a great job of reminding me to take a break. Blink. Do a pushup and then get back into flow.</p>

Which, is to say, our variant - where you pay for the full forty hours and only enforce thirty two total hours of actual work. This varient, to me, is the most human way to do things and I&rsquo;ll break down those reason briefly here</p>
<ol>
<li>No one cares on Friday</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been many places where Friday was just an ass in seats policy implication. No one wants to push to production. No one wants to have a meeting. Lunch goes an extra hour and people just aren&rsquo;t fucking engaged. So why? Why force people to be in the office when they don&rsquo;t want to be. Why force them to hang out and send memes when they can be home (working if they want on projects they care about) or just taking time to enjoy their families. Or what a number of people do, schedule dentist/doctor appointments instead of using the other work days</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When you need people they&rsquo;ll show up</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing ive noticed is that when, we do need to push. People show up and they care and they try, because we, as a company gave them time. We respected their time, so when something broke off hours - its not an issue of coverage, its just taken care of. Thats something you don&rsquo;t see with over taxed engineering teams. You get crispy responses and while we still have a root cause analysis the next work day, we aren&rsquo;t dealing with have dead engineers.</p>
<p>I could find more bullets, and I probably should, given the number of times ive had to defend this cultural choice. But its deep in me, that part of me that just enjoys working without structure. Which I get to do, if I want on Fridays. I can spin up a microservice or I can go walk with my wife - I can go for a run and not worry im not in by 10am. I love it and I love giving that freedom to anyone who we employ. Honestly, its one of the few things in my life I don&rsquo;t mind defending - especially when folks hate it because we could be doing &lsquo;more&rsquo;. Well, sure, you can always have people doing more, but the thing is</p>
<p>That shouldn&rsquo;t be the fucking requirement. People need to be motivated, and what motivates someone more than by telling them they get some of their life back to work on what they want.</p>

This can include a process of journaling and mock code in comments, writing in a notebook designs and consideration and even writing documentation for the feature or application..</p>
<p>This way of pseudocoing is one of my favorite activities when doing new feature development or when dickering around with new ideas. The reason being, is it lets me sit with the idea like a designer. To really think about the inputs and outputs and generally understand the problem set before blindly tackling the issue.</p>
<p>Earlier in my career, the idea of TDD development came into popular practice and I remember just thinking. &ldquo;This is like pseudocoding but with more steps&rdquo;, because while I was building out tests, I wasn&rsquo;t actually thinking about what the structure of the solution was going to be. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about interfaces. I was blindly guessing at what inputs id want and what outputs id need. But, I can feel some confusion in those statements. As to why it would be all that different and ill explain.</p>
<p>The difference lies in the execution. So here is a quick example of some off topic coding I was doing earlier this week</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-gdscript3" data-lang="gdscript3"><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># I want to create a circuit breaker system for failover</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">### check out libraries that may have this already! (chore)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## first i need to understand what the breaker activities are defined</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">--</span> to many signups
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">--</span> to many requests
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">--</span> is this throttling<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## middleware considerations</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>global activities w<span style="color:#f92672">/</span> breakers
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> (x) <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span> allow <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> deny activity
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So those first comments are the building blocks of what will eventually be a feature. While, it doesn&rsquo;t look like much, those comments will remain in my code until I have a moment to revise and push up the code into the remote repository.</p>
<p>Again, this all comes down to personal style, but I wanted to share a little of how I write code prior to cleaning things up. Since honestly, I love writing and this journaling helps me understand before I write any code. So maybe if you are like me and prefer writing things down before methods are written, doing something similar can help.</p>

<p>The Quote:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.&rdquo; ~ Carl Yung</em></p>
<p>Why it matters:</p>
<p>So often, at least in my life, its been an irritation. A small misunderstanding, between my world and another persons. Id say its a gap, but its more than that, I look at a person and im confused as to why they can&rsquo;t bend their thinking or accept the world. But its that, its my view of the world and I don&rsquo;t know why I would expect someone else to see their world any differently than how I see it differently. So its the feeling of irritation. Its a tell. Its a possible moment for me to grow and try to bend my own world view - be it empathy or just meditation, the act is important. Since the act is what will provide the insight, into whether their world is something I should be trying to explore or a missed understanding within my own</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I spent a long time thinking about what I should be writing for today and tomorrow.

It goes with the territory, and it can drive you up a wall. I know personally from having to watch production channels in slack slowly fill with issues that it can become a scheduling issue. When do we fix the issue? Whos impacted and why can&rsquo;t we just spend one sprint without having to do a hotfix. So without further ado, ill unveil to you all the way I personally score issues that come flooding in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about following A.W.S.H.I.T, get those calculators ready</p>
<h3 id="a-impact">A. impAct</h3>
<p>How many people is this bug/issue going to impact. Which is usually the quick gut check of the blast radius. For example, a login issue, where no one can enter the app, yeah, it has to be fixed. It needs to be fixed yesterday but now works. Add +/++/+++ depending on how many folks this is going to upend if things don&rsquo;t get fixed</p>
<h3 id="w-wizardry">W. wizardry</h3>
<p>What is the lift in terms of magic scripting that its going to take to fix the issue (or at least duct tape it). If the amount of the incantations are too much then it might need to wait. Add a &lsquo;+&rsquo; for a simple incantation, &lsquo;++&rsquo; for complex.</p>
<h3 id="s-stability">S. stability</h3>
<p>Is this issue the only issue? Or has this issue caused instability in the rest of the application. If the cure is worse than the disease it might as well wait until a better fix comes in. Otherwise add another &lsquo;+&rsquo; to the score</p>
<h3 id="h-hosed">H. hosed</h3>
<p>This is costing you not only customer experience, this is costing you money. Its like that scene from the &lsquo;princess bride&rsquo;, where you are watching the years coming off your Westly. Its not looking good. If your actively losing money AND customer buy-in add another &lsquo;+&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Your devs have been working really hard on these new features and then this bug happened. It was the best of times and then it was these times, these really awful times where flow becomes sludge. Welp, welcome to the insanity of releasing things out into the wild without perfect conditions. It happens. However, now you get to add a &lsquo;+&rsquo; if you know this is going to set back the schedule by having a dedicated resource lose out on future development for sanity now.</p>
<h3 id="t-testing">T. testing</h3>
<p>Hey, works on my machine. IF the bug is critical and the fix needs thorough testing - add another &lsquo;+&rsquo; since you just took a poor QA resource and now are having them work to ensure that the update won&rsquo;t cause a cascade of more work.</p>
<h3 id="scoring">scoring</h3>
<ul>
<li>0 - 4: Just toss it into the next sprint, its bad, but it could be worse</li>
<li>5 - 7: Again, not worth the distraction, next sprint</li>
<li>8 - 10: Now. Unfortunatly now is a good time to fix this</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision to fix or wait on fixing a production issues should be weighed against a lot of factors. The above acronym aside, it&rsquo;s still important to discuss the issue in full in a slack/matrix/irc thread. To document it through a five whys exercise or do any other due dilligence that makes sense.</p>

<p>Back in Febuary, I was going through some articles on <a href="https://social.coop">social.coop</a> a mastmastodon instance that describes itself as being <code>A Fediverse instance for people interested in cooperative and collective projects.</code>.
As im likely to do, I have been slowly networking and checking out all the culture and discussions from the instance to self inform and make myself a slightly more informed netizen. The content on the site is especially resonating since
I love cooperatives and have wanted to create a similar structure for myself and other developers in Colorado. Which, is in itself another rabbit hole but ill digress. I stumbled upon a really interesting looking
<a href="https://decentsocial.net/">descent social</a> that promised this idea of an <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unconference">unconference</a> which, at the time I hadn&rsquo;t known was a thing. Intrigued I read through the site
and realized that I had missed the party by a few days. Nothing seemed to remain from the event, no streamers or downed flipper zeros. Just a whole lot of nothing. So I decided to dig in.</p>
<p>First, I scrapped together what links I could find, which lead to a <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/0lAUPI1cwF7NaqBG7MBCoxgVPNWavIyaKGYk3pb9TZM/embed/present/">cryptpad.fr</a> sheet, full of links and schedules. Which, also explained the format, which like I said earlier was new to me. Personally digging the idea of having conferences so self driven. Using libera.chat and matrix was neat as well, I hadn&rsquo;t used matrix before so I was keen on learning what that technology was good for. So many IM platforms come and go its always neat to find another one. Im talking about you <a href="https://gitter.im/">Gitter</a> - I never understood why these technologies splinter so much and so far. But that could be its own blog article.</p>
<p>Second, i followed the dead link to a neat platform called <a href="https://www.meet.coop/">meet.coop</a> which looks like a really neat conference tool that would have cleaned house in 2020. So I ended up marking that down as possible software and kept moving on as I still didn&rsquo;t have any of the information outside of the schedule id found in that cryptpad.</p>
<p>Finally, I ran dry of the main site so I went over to google and started searching. One of the first things that turned up was a hackmd article from <a href="https://hackmd.io/@decentsocial">2022-12-09</a>, that lead to a github account over at <a href="https://github.com/decent-social">descent-social</a> which didn&rsquo;t have much. Looked like it was just the website that was being served at the top of this article. Hmm</p>
<p>So back to the google board. Using some other source control exact matching. I turned up a win on codeberg which is another gitea, forge, kinda repository of repositories. Seeing their <a href="https://codeberg.org/DecentSocial">codeberg</a> site was great and made me feel like I was onto something because in there was <a href="https://codeberg.org/DecentSocial/2023-02-notes">NOTES</a>!!!! Not just any notes mind you jekyll notes.</p>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/nhKW2pvXwI8mc" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/scene-park-unix-nhKW2pvXwI8mc">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>So I had notes and could finally attend the party but that was only the start.</p>
<h1 id="finding-atacama">Finding Atacama</h1>
<p>One of the notes, <a href="https://codeberg.org/DecentSocial/2023-02-notes/raw/branch/main/pages/atacama-anon-and-distributed.md">this one</a>, made mention of a mysterious speaker known as @hoody. This person went on to speak about SSB (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Secure_Scuttlebutt">secure scuttlebutt</a>) protocol and their drive to create something from distributed web communities.</p>
<p>Personally, having tried other network like Nostr, I was intrigued by the choices that this speaker had disscussed, specifcally I loved the idea that the platform was fully anonymous, stay on your phone, and seemed like a platform you could just jump on and off as ya pleased.</p>
<p>The one problem. Was I couldn&rsquo;t find a link to a beta of it at all.</p>
<p>So that started my next rabbit hole adventure, which was to find &lsquo;atacama&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rather then go through the steps above, id say a good amount of searching for that user brought me to a twitter user tag of <code>hoodownr</code> that had done a really neat <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hoodownr-game-of-discovery">indiegogo campaign</a> a few years back. Also found a patreon for that person, but it wasn&rsquo;t setup. Also ran into a dead end on <a href="https://github.com/oli0/Hoodownr">github</a>.</p>
<p>But, after putting hoodownr into the github search, I ran across a user of the <a href="https://github.com/hoodownr">same name</a> and while the account seemed barren except for a few repos. The about information had a twitter and what appeared to be a link to <a href="https://moderator.rocks">moderator.rocks</a>. So I intrepidly clicked the link.</p>

<p>Nothing says fun and excitement like a homepage on IPFS and an android package you have to trick your phone into downloading. Regardless, I was excited to see this and some of these descriptions brought to mind my own thoughts about bluesky, twitter, etc</p>
<p>Well, in any case I had found the project that I didn&rsquo;t know I wanted and have been using the very small android application to post small wins throughout my day. Its refreshing given all the new development into decentralized social platforms that this one seems to be small and has given this a lot of thought and really feels like its a labor of love.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it was a really fun follow breadcrumbs. Im really hoping next year to catch the meetup and see what other projects people are presenting.</p>

<h1 id="the-origin">The origin</h1>
<p>Started out by looking at a few articles and even seeing what chatGPT would say in terms
of what the file structure should look like. Much like salt, ive been blown away with the variety
of approaches for golang file hierarchy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kevinhohl/petstore">Classic Implementation - PetStore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/quii/todo">todo with htmx spike</a></li>
<li>thanks <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/10z4z3j/go_time_266_is_htmx_the_way_to_go/">random reddit thread</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I left the chatGPT resource out of it because it kinda failed hilariously which may have just been the issue
of the LLM model ending in 2021. Who knows, but deep inside my breathing relaxes. For much like death, AI isn&rsquo;t taking
my job today.</p>
<p>I really liked the quii todo css style and the static file layout. Felt like MVC was making a come back, but I wasn&rsquo;t
as big of a fan towards moving everything into a domain directory so I kinda went and reworked the ideas from petstore
app.</p>
<h2 id="side-note">Side note</h2>
<p>Im also not super sure that Clover is going to be the end all goal. I started fiber with the prefork option to true which
meant that SO_REUSEPORT was enabled. Which is amazing, if you want to know more I think <a href="https://github.com/Fenny">Fenny</a> said
it best <a href="https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/180#issuecomment-590013111">here</a>, but that has some straight issues with
the way im working with clover as a data source. So I may need to see what client pooling is available for a critical section
that is basically a singleton.</p>
<p>So one alternative I thought about was using the Solid Protocol. This would allow me to save off the rss feeds and basically
get some free storage. It&rsquo;s mostly just a thought at this point but could be fruitful in the future.</p>
<h1 id="second-day">Second Day</h1>
<p>Going to start building the actual pulling and parsing multiple rss feeds. So look forward to more soon.</p>

It&amp;rsquo;s great to take a step back and just live without it.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The month started great, a dry January. Which of course meant a few nightmare induced nights from not drinking. Which is crazy to me, as I usually have a beer and two shots and call it a night. All I can think is its sugar withdrawal or some such. Anyway, I love dry January since it gives me some time to feel what the absence of alcohol is like on a normal monday through friday. I definitely feel I lean into having a beer after the kids get to sleep with the excuse that I deserve it or that I need help relaxing. It&rsquo;s great to take a step back and just live without it.</p>
<p>With alcohol out of the diet, those dreams I had when I was in my early twenties feel way closer. When I was nineteen, I remember just being so depressed because I was a pack a day smoker, drank nightly, got terrible rest and figured that was going to my life. Now that ive been able to balance my habits, it feels really refreshing to look back and just see how much progress ive made.</p>
<p>For, January, I also kept up with a daily journaling habit. This has been great in keeping my thoughts organized and keep myself on target. Honestly it started out more as daily journal entries with some bare minimum of what happened during the day. Then over time the entries started expanding into more personal issues about daily issues. Its been wild watching those thoughts leave my mental echo chamber. I don&rsquo;t really go back and expand on those points, but I feel its good they are out on paper. The only real issue with the entries is that I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable writing very personal things, I keep thinking like someone is going to read the entries and be like GOT YA. Which is funny as a forty something.</p>
<p>Other highlights from this month&hellip; Going to the Denver Zoo lights was pretty awesome. I love the way they do up the zoo and I am really just a sucker for christmas lights in general. The kids definitely are going to more activities again which is great, but is stretching us a bit thin in terms of time off during the weekends. Getting back to an in person D&amp;D session has been great (even though we most likely wont be doing 5e after this campaign). Oh, a big highlight this month was removing twitter and getting back into RSS Feeds. What a great change of pace to fulfill endless consumption of tech news. lol.</p>

Then, when coming to this website ive found it especially hard when it comes to figuring out what would be an interesting read.
So I typically end up reading more on the subject of coming up with subjects. Wherein I found the holy grail and as others before me
found this great strategy to ruminate on ideas. The all magical slipbox made popular by niklas luhmann.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been researching on the how now for awhile. The concept, that in itself feels simple has so many variations based on the person
interpreting the how. I was able to distill down what works for me digitally, but still find that it lacks a lot. So then I wonder, what
im doing wrong. Especially when it comes to my pride as a novice researcher. So this post is a little bit about that research and a little
about the steps im taking in my obsidian vault to merge concepts.</p>
<h2 id="the-stack">The Stack</h2>
<ol>
<li>Obsidian.md w/ sync option</li>
<li>Para Method</li>
<li>Bullet Journal</li>
<li>A voice recorder</li>
<li>Readwise</li>
<li>Pocket and Instapaper</li>
<li>Hypothesis</li>
<li>Zotero</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-things-work-together">How things work together</h2>
<p>The two work horses of the stack are going to be obsidian (digital) and the bullet journal (analog). These two are used in tandem to create a
unified input experience. Since my day to day is mostly spent behind a computer the bullet journal is a nice relief from staring at screens
however I have found that with both a good amount of dallying occurs. To be specific, there is a cycle of reviewing entries / fleeting notes
and crafting new ideas. Which is fine, thats kinda the point. At least its better than doom scrolling twitter.</p>
<p>The underlying structures for each medium are based off of different strategies. The bujo is going to follow the structure that was passionately
laid out by Ryder Carroll in &lsquo;The bullet journal method&rsquo;. While the structure provided to obsidian is modeled off of the PARA Method, laid out in &lsquo;Building a second brain&rsquo; by Tiago Forte, for folder layout then a slipbox in the resources area.</p>
<p>The slipbox is mostly following advice from &lsquo;How to take smart notes&rsquo; by Sönke Ahrens.  Which involves taking fleeting note. Which is a single page in the bujo or a &lsquo;Fleeting Note&rsquo; / simple
note in Obsidian. Then taking time at the end of the day to move them into a permanet note which
is then referenced by a map of content. Which is a index of underlying information around a subject
of interest. On a side, originally I had thought that the slipbox would be highly organized but its
really not. Its just kind of a mess of subjects that are intreguing that you tend to <em>want</em> to expand upon just because.</p>
<p>The last bit of the slipbox is the use of Zoterto for keeping track of where the information is coming from. Since splitting the reference note is supposed to remain independent of the permanent note. While this, I personally feel, only helps people doing more academic research ive tried to keep to the methodology.</p>
<p>The last bit, Readwise, Pocket, Instapaper and Hypothesis are all very fun and enjoyable to in creating a digital funnel. Basically as im running around the internet and pulling up information if its an article I don&rsquo;t have time to read I slap the &lsquo;Instapaper&rsquo; extension and <strong>BAM</strong> the information is ready to go next time I pull up the instapaper app. Aside from that instapaper has some unique in&rsquo;s from email sources that I use for various newsletters. Pocket I reserve for bookmarking simply because I needed a better bookmark tool. Then Hypothesis is great with grabbing random highlights across the web.</p>
<p>Readwise, is amazing. I&rsquo;ve been using it for around 455 days consistently now and while I disagree with the amount of &lsquo;Catcher and the Rye&rsquo; quotes it keeps showing me the actually funnel into obsidian is very impressive. It basically works like this</p>
<div class="center-it" style="  text-align: center;">

<h2 id="the-daily-practice">The daily practice</h2>
<p>So having setup Obsidian using the aforementioned PARA method and having the bujo setup. The daily practice is usually to do the following in the morning</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on the pomodoro</li>
<li>Create daily note in obsidian</li>
<li>Create the bujo daily note and check any forgotten tasks</li>
<li>Take the notes from the bujo transfer to obsidian daily note</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that these steps don&rsquo;t use any slipnote methodologies and thats because the first focus of the day is on tasks. The slip box is used for developing ideas and expanding them which should happen through the day but isn&rsquo;t explicit.</p>

to have an excellent partial to follow. Mostly using the getJson function from hugo. The only
real gotcha was remembering to use <code>hugo serve --ignoreCache</code>.</p>
<p>So as for receiving webmentions, all done and complete. However, the real fun was just starting.
When looking into how to actually send webmentions, it looks like I get to do some coding. My
approach is to use vercel as a lambda to activate a scan of my rss feed whenever I publish a specific
kind of taxonmy in hugo.</p>
<p>So I started with these steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Add custom rss field for if im mentioning anothers site, like a comment. I did this through creating an index.rss.html in layouts/_default</li>
<li>Create a new github project, I used this <a href="https://github.com/riccardogiorato/template-go-vercel">template</a> as an example for how to setup the vercel project</li>
<li>I signed up with <a href="https://upstash.com/">upstash</a>, so i could have a little cloud db. Since its only for saving webmentions it should be low maintenance</li>
<li>Started to psuedo code up the implementation</li>
</ol>

<p>For a book I grabbed on a whim from the library, this was a really fun read. The unique writing style. Almost
Terry Pratchetesk was a true treat.</p>
<p>Highly recommend</p>

A book in which the protagonist and environment, were constant highlights. The

Peaceful descriptions and endless ocean waves. Put me in a mood that I hadn&rsquo;t felt since I was younger. Listening
to the ocean ebb and flow. crash and dance.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t recommend this book enough. Even the ending pages were spellbinding. Tugging on slight anchors from one world

<ol>
<li>Filip, his character ark in this book was fantastic. The slow realization of who
his father is. Really is. Was as heartbreaking as it was liberating when he finally
takes on the &lsquo;Nagata&rsquo; surname.</li>
<li>Bobby, im a sucker for a good rambo scene. So the attack in the slow zone was
especially fun. As the antonym scene from her being stuck in an airlock. Unable to
help anyone.</li>
<li>Peaches, finally gets some recognition outside of her body augmentations.</li>
</ol>
<p>All-in-all, 👍 great book and highly recommended.</p>

<p>Sometimes I read a book and I start laughing at just how bad things
keep getting regardless of the beste intentions of the characters in
the book. Having now gone through a few of these expanse books, I knew
that the crew of the Rocinante, were going to see wild things in the
through the gates. But I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine how entertaining the middle
of this book would be.</p>
<p>It was just a smothering of humans being the worst version of themselves, yet again.</p>
<p>Also the side plot of the scientist being attracted to Holden was great. I think
the author could have played with Holdens polyamorous upbringing a bit more just
given those sorts of relationships wouldnt have been super alien to him. But, it
was addressed so I give the author a :+1: for that.</p>
<p>Really fun book and really nice character archs for some short lived side characters.</p>

<p>So now that the database can be mucked with it was easy enough to run

I played around with that for a bit just because migration tooling is neat.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The end?</h2>
<p>Now I just need to write the code for the migration of older audit records. So if any neat code comes up, I&rsquo;ll write it
on here.</p>

<p>Decided that I wanted an audit db and service to help keep track of user behaviors.
Since I already have some in Redis, and some in Postgres I thought this might be a useful exercise.
The main thing id like to accomplish with this code is going to be a way to track events and break
them down by week/month/year per user and per company.</p>
<p>Im having some self debate about creating tables for the tallies or if I should just be creating
them on the fly using a query. I like the idea of the tally because it would be a place to easily
look that information up. Although if some error occurs it could possibly be inaccurate.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h1 id="audit-service">Audit Service</h1>

<p>Deciding on a good schema, im thinking something like</p>
<p><em>audit table</em></p>
<ul>
<li>userId</li>
<li>companyName (i dislike using company id because then you have to look it up)</li>
<li>timestamp</li>
<li>event</li>

<p><em>user tally table</em></p>

<p>Maybe just using rds would be a better fit. The amount of scanning would be pretty awful. Ok, abandoning idea!</p>

<p>I keep feeling like there has to be a way to manage GTD, alongside
tools that im working with daily because seriously, the amount
of context switching in terms of apps/sites to plan any one project
seems crazy.</p>
<h2 id="current-setup">Current Setup</h2>
<p>Right now my usual task propagation is from vim into trello for personal
projects and pivotal tracking for professional projects.</p>
<p>Then while working on tasks  &lsquo;Be Focused Pro&rsquo; tracking pomodoro time iterations.</p>
<p>Notes are done either through vim, samsung notes or evernotes.</p>
<p>Bookmarking is handled from pocket.</p>
<p>But I really don&rsquo;t have any way to index ideas or sort through anything. So I keep bouncing around
all sorts of productivity ideas, bullet journals, more note-taking apps, things like GTD to try
and wrangle all the things. But nothing really sticks.</p>
<h2 id="what-works">What works</h2>
<p>I like how simple trello is. I like how simple vim is. I love markdown for note taking. When reading
articles on virtual gardens or second brains, it seems like the ability to search and structure data
is what makes the most sense. But does hugo provide that, kinda, I think id probably need to restrict
the frontpage from displaying notes. But slugs should do a good job of keeping projects together.</p>

pwn of online search ive seen fewer and fewer webrings when organically surfing around the internet.</p>
<h2 id="indie-web">indie web</h2>
<p>Turns out, that web ring was also a movement that had started as far back as 2014, so being the hipster that I am
I started digging into movement. Stumbling across concepts like POSSE and digital gardens I became enthralled and a
little jealous. Its been years since ive worked on my own brand, or my own digital vision. So seeing that a movement
had sprung up that fosters that sort of growth was really something.</p>
<h1 id="on-being-creative">On being creative</h1>
<p>Ive been posting poetry and creative writing under a shell name now for over a year. Its been a way to relax when writing
and not worry so much about writing under, well, my name. Since &lsquo;my name&rsquo;, is associated to being a cto for a startup.
Associated with friends and family. I dont know, its just a really freeing experience to not worry about the people who
can associated you with your writing.</p>
<p>Im guessing that most people can understand that. Its what used to make travel so appealing. Nothing better than rolling
into a new pub and grabbing a drink with people who don&rsquo;t know your name. Its an experience in self building.</p>
<p>But the downside, I now have over a year of work under a shell name. I won&rsquo;t be able to move those over to this account
without someone figuring that out. But, who knows, maybe there are enough people in the world now that one person writing
poetry isnt a big deal. Maybe its just some latent elementary angst.</p>
<h2 id="this-blog-meets-indie-web">this blog meets indie web</h2>
<p>To that end, im going to be trying to incorporate more of the concepts ive been reading about from indieweb then writing
about those implementations here.</p>

<p>I was reading through the docker documentation for docker registry and ran into this curious idea of nondistributable
artifacts and how that related to some layers that are proprietary. Which got me thinking about how I could setup
my own non distributable layers.</p>
<p>So looking into <code>microsoft/windowsservercore</code> I figured since those had some foreign layers I could take a gander at what
was in the manifest which made particular layers &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;. But on pulling the image to my linux box I got the helpful error
of <code>image operating system &quot;windows&quot; cannot be used on this platform</code>. Which makes perfect sense since containers depend on
the host machine for the proper resources.</p>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2 id="the-mystery">The Mystery</h2>

<h3 id="next">Next&hellip;</h3>
<p>So, the search begins for finding some more information around foreign layers and how to specify them within a manifest,
dockerfile or registry&hellip;</p>
