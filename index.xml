<p>TL;DR If the purpose of AI is to become a programmers best friend, shouldn&rsquo;t we address a few issues in open source funding first?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was first coming up in programming, it was the early 90s. I was lucky and had the privilege to have a computer that was able to run a very early version of turbo linux red hat edition. I was even more lucky that I didn&rsquo;t cook the monitor I had. But that aside, programming was help files and programming was begging to find technical books because at the end of the day, you didn&rsquo;t have alot of resources to learn from. From my experience you had:</p>
<ul>
<li>BBS, Usenet, IRC, etc</li>
<li>Technical Books</li>
<li>Manual Files</li>
<li>Uncompiled procedural code</li>
</ul>
<p>So that was it for me. I basically spent all the money I could on shareware and technical books trying to guess what would make the most sense to learn. At the time I had a dual boot going. So I pinged between working in ms-dos batch files and trying to understand X11. Which as funny as that sounds now, I really do have a memory of being stuck in vim and having to shamefully reboot the computer because I didn&rsquo;t know the magic of <code>:q</code>. So before the nostalgia overtakes me, let me get to the point.</p>
<p>The barrier for entry in programming, was money.</p>
<p>It was a time when knowledge had a price and it was kept behind lock and key. What must seem a triviality now, I remember first buying &lsquo;Encarta&rsquo; and thinking, &lsquo;holy shit&rsquo;, im never need to go to the library again to cumbersomely read an encyclopedia. Which, to that point, id begged my parents for more than the letter &lsquo;M&rsquo; encyclopedia we owned. So that to me was MY first experience of the barrier coming down a little bit. Now, ill admit, this was only for general knowledge, not programming, but it was the first time people started copying and pasting sections of Encarta and using them in schools. I was in 7th grade at the time and have a memory of a kid getting caught using verbatim copy/paste encarta entries as a paper.</p>
<p>Now my own journey was also enriched during this time period because of the rise of the internet. I was there with Mosaic on windows 3.11, I was there when netscape first blazed to life with midi and animated gifs. Which for an aspiring developer was like a drug. But more than that, you could read any webpage by easily looking at the source code. It was intoxicating. This was a time of simple web editors, of geocities and it was the early internet. Which, to be honest I really never thought would catch on. It was so fun but it was super campy. It was a quilt of people and a snapshot of the early/mid nineties.</p>
<p>So for me, I began learning more javascript and html, just because it was easier to learn. The resources were a bit more accessible. So much like Encarta, the barrier to entry for web development was lower. Were there still pieces to serving html that were hard? Sure, CGI-Bin was still a foreign concept, php and asp were still fighting, as well as developing in perl (which would be a life long love).</p>
<p>Later, after the dot com burst and recovery. So early 2000s, I had landed my first technical job as a web developer, now in my twenties. The world was largely the same. I still had a pile of books in front of me. &lsquo;Javascript the good parts&rsquo;, &lsquo;Perl Cookbook&rsquo;, &lsquo;Unix/Linux Admin Manual&rsquo;, etc. My cubical resembled a modern day wizards tabernacle with all the dr. pepper cans hot glued to create a wizard staff. It was challenging because even though the books had the answers for most anything you wanted to build. I would still need to pour over them and decipher there secrets. Working with team members we eventually put together a really interesting animation library, we figured out how to normalize javascript between browsers and were making a go of it.</p>
<p style="padding:10px; text-align:center">
  <img class="thumbnail" src="https://bneil.me/images/mootools-payoff.png" height="150"  />
</p>
<p>Then, moo tools came out. Then, jquery came out. Things that took the work we had done and brought them into the forefront. Available to everyone. So in a moment, I got to watch a year of work and of some really great learning with coworkers get tossed away. I wasn&rsquo;t jealous, but I was sad, because I knew that open source technology could take away a problem that an organization would pay for. The company that paid for my time wasn&rsquo;t having to pay for jquery. So that was the first time I felt, kinda bad. It wasn&rsquo;t like my employer was paying the folks at jquery. I was the one having to relearn and my contributions were abysmal because at the time it was a world where (at least the orgs id been in) didn&rsquo;t contribute back.</p>
<p>Then, also, was the rise of Expert Exchange. Which was the first time outside of random forums/newsgroups, people started to congregate and solve common problems. I got there because I was trying to look up simple errors that would happen to apache, or weird javascript errors. But the thing was, the Exchange was behind a paywall. Well sure enough, a year or so later, Stack Overflow came in like an asteroid and with people helping people, or open sourcing the problem space. Experts Exchange went away and even more developers could be brought in to play. No longer did you &rsquo;need&rsquo; those large technical books. Mostly the documentation and stack overflow would be enough. I still found myself buying books. Hell, at one time I truly believed that if I had access to all the o&rsquo;reily books I could get any job in the industry.</p>
<p>So what im trying to say is, during my life as a developer ive seen the barrier to entry go down. From needing quite a lot of grit and expertise to hitting up google and searching.</p>
<p>Then of course, we had this massive increase in web frameworks after 2010, this was great in normalizing (think web2.0 but for front end ux experience) the front end space. This allowed for standardization in colleges and allowed code schools to start really getting the number of new programmers into the field. I think even president Obama had asked the american people to look into computer science. It was a lot of flooding of new talent into the industry for jobs that could actually met the cost of living. Which im sorry to say, is the hardest pill to swallow.</p>
<p style="padding:10px; text-align:center">
  <img class="thumbnail" src="https://bneil.me/images/ai-brain.png" height="150"  />
</p>
<p>So at this point, your probably wondering, what? this hasn&rsquo;t been a rant on AI. Where is the AI bashing.</p>
<p>Well, its here and its not. AI as ive used it so far, which is just the beginning, can do some basic programming tasks. However as of this date, using claude, chatgpt, and gemini - hasn&rsquo;t resulted in very much &lsquo;good&rsquo; code. Its mostly sloppy and it doesn&rsquo;t know what its talking about. However, its taking that barrier to entry for anyone non technical and moved the bar. Making it seem like you can get away with a much smaller work force.</p>
<p>AI lies impressively and the prompts ive seen are very good at creating error filled code with a lot of confidence.</p>
<p>Its kinda terrible.</p>
<p>But it does have me asking. Whats the end goal for this technology? If it does succeed and someday has the singularity of experience of a developer. What happens to me? Is it like the lamp lighters of the early 1900s. What happens to all those people who went through code schools who are chasing a cost of living?</p>
<p>There are so many societal considerations to take into account and things id love to see &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; or even some open questions addressed</p>
<ol>
<li>Is open source fundamentally ruined because it doesn&rsquo;t address monetary concerns of contributors</li>
<li>Why can&rsquo;t people that provide value to the world get more of the capital</li>
<li>Why do things that intrinsically benefit society get the least amount of capital</li>
<li>How do AI companies create benefits for open source? LLM&rsquo;s learned from them shouldn&rsquo;t it pay that back?</li>
</ol>
<p>I personally am thinking those over but wanted to get them on paper first because its interesting how often they seem to bubble up in conversation.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<h2 id="reaching-out-but-hitting-dead-ends">Reaching Out but Hitting Dead Ends</h2>
<p>This week in trying to drum up work, I&rsquo;ve been focused on expanding my client base. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a rollercoaster ride - some promising leads, but a lot of dead ends as well.</p>
<p>Early in the week, I reached out to a few companies I thought could really benefit from my technical expertise. Had a great initial call with the CEO of a fintech startup, and they seemed really interested in working with me. We discussed their pain points in depth and I outlined how our team could help streamline their engineering processes and infrastructure. But after following up multiple times, I haven&rsquo;t heard back. It&rsquo;s frustrating when you feel like you&rsquo;ve made a real connection, only to have the trail go cold.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience with a retail company exploring a major digital transformation. The VP of IT was enthusiastic about my capabilities and we had a productive brainstorming session. They were looking to increase the use of Terraform but when it came time to get a proposal together, all communication suddenly stopped. I&rsquo;m not sure if budget constraints, a change in leadership, or just general inertia got in the way, but it&rsquo;s disheartening to put in that initial effort only to have the opportunity slip away.</p>
<h2 id="searching-for-a-full-time-role">Searching for a Full-Time Role</h2>
<p>In addition to my fractional CTO work, I&rsquo;ve also been actively searching for a full-time CTO position. I&rsquo;ve applied to a number of promising openings, and have had some encouraging initial conversations. However, I&rsquo;m finding that the interview process can be quite drawn out, with multiple rounds of discussions and assessments.</p>
<p>I recently made it through to the final stages for a solutions architect role at a promising AI startup, only to be told that they&rsquo;ve decided to postpone the hire indefinitely due to funding uncertainty. It was disappointing, but a good reminder that these kinds of decisions can be out of my control.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Through these setbacks, I&rsquo;ve learned that persistence are key. Just because an opportunity didn&rsquo;t pan out doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s dead forever. I&rsquo;m making a note to follow up with those leads again in a few months - priorities and decision-makers can shift quickly in the startup world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also realized the importance of networking and referrals. Many of my most fruitful client relationships have come through warm introductions from existing contacts. So I&rsquo;m redoubling my efforts to expand my professional network. So we&rsquo;ll see how that goes next week.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it&rsquo;s been a challenging week, but I know these kinds of setbacks are all part of the job. Onward and upward.</p>

The way I remember context, is that its a wrapper around information you want to pass all around your program. You have special switches to kill the context and forget it ever existed.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p style="text-align:center">

<p>I&rsquo;ve used the context package alot with basically little thought, so I figured it would be helpful to have a few notes on the use and reason behind it for later reference. So hopefully this can help future devs and myself later on if I forget.</p>
<p>The way I remember context, is that its a wrapper around information you want to pass all around your program. You have special switches to kill the context and forget it ever existed. But really its a way to keep &lsquo;context&rsquo; of an action or series of actions.</p>
<p>Think of it like a journal. You can write to it and reference it throughout its lifecycle. Wherever and whenever you need.</p>
<p>So for the easy example</p>

<p>It works like a jukebox, where wg.Add to adds a new song and once your your songs over you say wg.Done (usually done in a defer). To play another song you do the same thing.
Once all songs are done, the code beneath wg.Wait, will be run. Usually, this is done at the end of program unless your creating some interesting state machine. But lets look at the example</p>

<p>oh one more note, you may see context.TODO rather than context.Background in your adventures. Don&rsquo;t Panic.
Its &lsquo;basically&rsquo; the same thing as background except its meant to be temporary. Where background is there for the long haul, todo, is more placeholder in nature
So it can be indicitive of a test or just a placeholder.</p>

<p>Anyhow, hope these examples help you and I know ill reference them for myself later. So for now, thanks for reading.</p>

<h2 id="trusting-your-gut-the-key-to-fulfilling-work">Trusting Your Gut: The Key to Fulfilling Work</h2>
<p><em>or how to stop attending meetings that make you feel sick</em></p>
<p>Have you ever found yourself dreading a meeting, only to leave it feeling completely drained and uninspired? I&rsquo;ve been there, and it&rsquo;s not a pleasant experience. In fact, it&rsquo;s one of the main reasons I recently stepped down from my last role.</p>
<p>Working in an environment with an endless stream of mandatory meetings was slowly sucking the life out of me. I would get this terrible feeling of anxiety and existential dread leading up to these gatherings, and no matter how much I tried to rationalize it, I just couldn&rsquo;t shake the belief that they weren&rsquo;t serving me or the company well.</p>
<p>The thing is, I&rsquo;m someone who derives a deep sense of purpose and fulfillment from the work I put in, not just from attending endless meetings. And while my coworkers would insist that &ldquo;meetings are work,&rdquo; I could never fully convince myself of that. In my gut, I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
<p>So when I started feeling that same knot in my stomach while working with certain consulting clients, I knew I had to make a change. I realized that I needed to start trusting my instincts and setting better boundaries - even if it meant cutting ties with a client sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s the thing: that gut feeling, that intuitive sense of unease, is often trying to tell us something important. It&rsquo;s a signal that the situation at hand may not be aligned with our values, our strengths, or our overall well-being. And when we ignore those signals, we end up feeling drained, anxious, and resentful.</p>
<p>But when we listen to our gut and make decisions accordingly, something magical happens. We start to feel more invigorated, more inspired, and more fulfilled in our work. We&rsquo;re able to pour our energy into the things that truly matter, rather than wasting it on meetings and tasks that leave us feeling empty.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone who constantly finds yourself dreading certain work obligations, I&rsquo;d encourage you to pause and really tune in to that gut feeling. What is it trying to tell you? Is this situation truly serving you, or is it time to set some boundaries and make a change?</p>
<p>It may feel uncomfortable at first, but I can assure you that the payoff is well worth it. By trusting your intuition and aligning your work with what energizes you, you&rsquo;ll not only be more productive and effective, but you&rsquo;ll also experience a newfound sense of joy and purpose in what you do.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t that what we all want, at the end of the day?</p>

</p>
<p>The last month, April 2024, has been a sobering time of calling friends, reaching out, networking,
and generally trying to find some space and some security. While not all of my endeavours were successful, with the help of a friend, was able to get some groundwork laid for staying afloat. So since, I do have a bit of a break, I thought Id reflect and write down my thoughts. Just some observations, really, from the last few years.</p>
<p>So, to start, I don&rsquo;t blame anyone. I believe most people work and act to the achieve the best results for themselves and for the projects they care the most about. In fact, its how I usually try and find folks to  work with. I find the people like me, care alot about technology and getting things done. Who care a lot about people and want to create a humane place to get that work done.</p>
<p>To that end, working with my old startup was on point. People cared, we only ever lost a team member to our  culture, once, and that is out of seven years. Which, to me is a great win.</p>
<p>Now no startup is perfect, some things I have been thinking about on reflection were:</p>
<ol>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t have a north star for what we built, even three years in you couldn&rsquo;t figure out what we did well. Whenever we did find that tagline or phrase, it changed.</li>
<li>The whole of the organization didn&rsquo;t have a hierarchy.</li>
<li>The sales pipeline was a mess, top of funnel was never a priority.</li>
<li>The company was losing money on the team, which is what we expected in a VC backed startup, but it was a death sentence.</li>
<li>The CEO directly made commitments that other c-level suite folks disagreed with and weren&rsquo;t aware of until they were promised. You haven&rsquo;t felt more powerless until you hear what you&rsquo;re on the hook for.</li>
<li>Too many pointless meetings</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, im <strong>not</strong> here to air out my dirty laundry from the past seven years and im certainly not going to do it from my own one sided point of view. I just want to discuss those points on their own merits and explain how I think they helped put the startup on the back foot. <em>Also, I just want it out of my head</em>. So let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>
<h3 id="the-company-tagline">The company tagline</h3>
<p>Just do it. Nike</p>
<p>Think big. IMAX</p>
<p>Belong anywhere. Airbnb</p>
<p>For us,</p>
<p>Widgets are the bottleneck for your companies growth&hellip; We are &rsquo;the&rsquo; Widget hub&hellip; We focus on getting Widgets done faster.</p>
<p>I realize that comparing yourself to Nike, IMAX, etc is not what you do as a startup. You find your fit. I&rsquo;ve often heard it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you pivot 100 times or stick to a single plan and execute. At the end of the day your only comparing lottery tickets. Those tickets can look vastly different depending on the leadership. But I have a problem with not being able to solidify a goal after three years. I need to have something I can look to, to turn to,  to understand vision when no one is around. When im trying to figure out the most important next step for engineering. I look left, look right and look in. Taking those internal mantra&rsquo;s and making them material.</p>
<p>So is it the most important, no. But it helps keep all departments rowing the same direction. Something we really needed every day, it was missing.</p>
<p>To that end, I think what I could have done better here, was in shepherding the consensus and driving it home with investors. If we believe that our special sauce is X, then the board should agree so they don&rsquo;t have any surprises. I think half the time what we spoke about internally was in stark difference towards the expectations of others. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t the CTO&rsquo;s duty, I should have made more of an effort to hold the management group to consensus. Because that&rsquo;s our job, brand the message.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-structure">Organizational structure</h3>
<p>So I think this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-software-product-democracy-jose-r-gorchs/">article</a> from Jose Gorch, did a fantastic job in outlining the issues I saw with the flat structure. Now mind you, thats just how folks work in engineering. We hold ourselves to the things we know best and trust product to do what they do best. So in essence by trusting each other, we naturally achieve great things. However, this can breakdown. It does so when the people creating the product are second and third guessed by upper management. That means, to be clear, you either hire someone as a product manager and let them deliver what your vision to the best of their ability. Or you do it, and admit you aren&rsquo;t clear enough to make that vision come into fruition.</p>
<p>It was painful for this lesson in particular. To see the inability for one team member to express, given all the process we put in place, to be successful. To time and time again hear, we didn&rsquo;t deliver on the promises we made. That gutted me and it gutted the team and it really rubbed me raw because the only thing in life we have is time. Wasting it is a travesty, mostly for me. But also because I/we could have focused on something better.</p>
<p>So is this about org structure, kinda. Its about communicating as an org, but its about leadership and what happens when that fails. I think flat orgs can work. But I don&rsquo;t think it works when the people involved don&rsquo;t understand the bottom line. If it&rsquo;s not clear from either top or bottom, you build the wrong thing. Thats the failure.</p>
<p>So I think this one was more of a lesson learned. Should have pumped the breaks on the consensus and gave people roles and expectations from day one. Namely that the upper management runs the show and that we are responsible if the company sinks. So setting expectations with the team, day one, on what happens when we miss goals and releases. We did &ldquo;try&rdquo; this a few times, but should have been consistent in holding people accountable to their KPI&rsquo;s. Like that should have been <em>the</em> measure and we didn&rsquo;t keep it consistent.</p>
<h3 id="on-using-vc-money">On using VC Money</h3>
<p>One of the key things I&rsquo;ve learned over the years is that losing money on a team is often par for the course, especially in the early stages of a VC-backed startups. In fact, it&rsquo;s typically a sign that the founders are investing heavily in building out their core operations and infrastructure.  However, when that loss starts to become a &ldquo;death sentence&rdquo; for the company, that&rsquo;s a red flag that needs to be addressed quickly. As CTO, I found it incredibly hard to see the runway shrinking and literally doing everything I could to keep the team aligned on where I believed we could strike out for the most value.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, revenue is what drives growth. So as a CTO watching burn rate and cash reserves became a think I was looking at everyday. The big thing for me, that I felt I did well was regardless of those financial challenges, I kept the focus on delivering value to our customers. Made sure that the things we were building and promising were tracked and that we communicated to the org why we were doing the things we were doing.</p>
<p>It really feels like a catch-22. When you have a vc backed company, you expect the vc&rsquo;s to bail you out. But if you can&rsquo;t float or show more growth in the industry, they aren&rsquo;t going to toss you a life raft. So the real lesson learned for me, was just slower growth. Because no amount of sweat can make other departments more effective. Given enough time, things can work out, but at a startup money is the only measure of success.</p>
<h3 id="sales">Sales</h3>
<p>If building software is the core of your business, then revenue is the lifeblood that keeps it running. Sales are the champions who move that revenue into your company&rsquo;s coffers. They may be the single most important factor in keeping the lights on and things moving forward. This is a critical point - growing too fast without a solid sales strategy can be the downfall of a startup.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect sales to just magically happen. You need to know how to effectively sell your product, who the right sales folks are, and a repeatable sales process to hand off to new hires. Your sales strategy shouldn&rsquo;t rely on 100% enterprise or corporate deals either - it needs to be multi-faceted to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>As the CTO, I should have been more involved in the sales process early on. Spending too much time gathering feedback from peripheral team members, while valuable, doesn&rsquo;t directly impact the bottom line. Being more hands-on with sales calls and even taking on a client or two myself would have given me better insight and allowed me to provide more informed guidance. Even if I wasn&rsquo;t driving sales, just observing and offering a technical perspective would have been hugely beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="surprises-during-all-hands">Surprises during all-hands</h3>
<p>Again, this one is another no brainer. Your c-level suite, needs to be involved in all the debate. Got it? Great. Now, what do you do after spending 3+ hours in a meeting pitching devils advocate. Finding consensus, going back to the drawing board, etc etc. What you don&rsquo;t do is take all that strategy and throw it out the window the first chance you get.</p>
<p>As the face for the company.  You don&rsquo;t hit all the points your c-suite told you not to. You don&rsquo;t &lsquo;read the room&rsquo; and tell them them anyway.</p>
<p>Because people listen to you as leadership.</p>
<p>They hold you higher for what you say than a co-worker.</p>
<p>Things shouldn&rsquo;t surprise your co-founders or your c-suite. They should all be up on the table and discussed. Because at the end of the day, its a team effort that keeps employee&rsquo;s around. If your making promises that I know don&rsquo;t match revenue, it is a problem. Even if you &lsquo;believe&rsquo; the money will materialize, its not an ethical place to steer from. Tell people, that we are doing everything but don&rsquo;t make promises.</p>
<p>So I should have quit. I should have recognized that this was a pattern and quit. I don&rsquo;t think you can come back from this breach of trust, I just don&rsquo;t. If you don&rsquo;t want to be made to be blamed for what someone is saying then you can&rsquo;t remain complicit after they have said it. It was no ones fault but my own, and of course a fear of losing my job when countless times I heard things that didn&rsquo;t align with what I knew to be true at the company. Whether that was to staff or to anyone. Its my own responsibility to be accountable when anyone says things that I don&rsquo;t agree with. So, it was a big red flag. Because at the end of the day, if a person knowingly continues to say things that are in disagreement with what you agree to say or do. Then its just them being them and you should do you.</p>
<h3 id="pointless-meetings">Pointless meetings</h3>
<p>I could write a novel on the amount of meetings that could have been an email. It&rsquo;s a trope at this point. But for some reason, they got so much worse near the end. Just the same meeting really.
A rehashing of the same dried leaves . Doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times you look. The writing is on the wall. So why are we having this meeting?</p>
<p>A good friend once told me that, meetings are working. They are worth looking into the camera, taking physical notes, and listening proactively. To engage in the meeting, because it&rsquo;s important. So
you know, I really liked that. For someone who, for years, didn&rsquo;t pay attention that much in meetings, I did. Which wasn&rsquo;t a light switch but it was good practice. To just keep my fingers off the
keyboard and try to paraphrase what the speaker is saying. Repeat it back and ask questions, even if they seem dumb, it never felt like the team made it out like I was saying something done. So if
nothing else, I really appreciated the idea, of not treating meetings like baggage but like something that is a formality of doing deep work.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t waste that time on pointless rehashing, you spend it with your team figuring out how to make hay into gold.</p>
<p>So thinking more about this, I think going forward, I will be more consistent in keeping an agenda, keeping people engaged through active participation, and really get better at treating a meeting like work. For more redundant conversations, I should have taken the time to bang the gavel, take stock of what was said, and figure out if we were just kicking the can. If we are, take those steps to re-focus the meeting and if not, embrace the new. So really, it&rsquo;s all about agency in those meetings, finding my own voice, and being consistent in using it to drive work forward.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>So, just to reiterate, I had a lot of fun in my last adventure. Looking for new ones all the time. Feeling a bit older now and feeling like I know better how to act professionally when the world around me isn&rsquo;t. How my strengths in listening, and in empathizing with people are getting stronger. But also realizing, that it takes adventures like the one ive had to become a more rounded person. So the bullets I wrote out definitely weren&rsquo;t all my learnings, but I felt that writing those thoughts up would be better served out of me then in. So in the end, hope you enjoyed the read and if you find one of those bullets that resonates with you leave a comment. Or just bookmark.</p>
<p>Take from this what makes you stronger and leave behind anything doesn&rsquo;t serve you anymore.</p>

<p>Got started on this book from a recommendation from my wife and wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. Devil in the white city by Erik Larson
goes into two pivotal events of the early
twentieth century in Chicago. One is the creation to execution of the 1893 worlds fair and the other being the serial killings of H. H. Holmes. The two events intertwine
during the creation, dedication and closure of the worlds fair. A fascinating read and while the horrific murders performed by Holmes
work as a shadow to the work done to create that spectacle. It touched me and the individual accounts of the fair were just
an amazing process to go through with the authors masterful help.</p>
<p>To speak to that darker shade from the book, Holmes, the way he comes off is just so self serving. Its hard to understand the mind of a serial killer. The idea that
this person is just compartmentalized the hurt of someone else into either a sexual or primal need is impossible to empathize with. As I read, it was
almost a constant game to him, the stealing and repetitive lying - that even after he was caught it seemed like it was just more about how the world
had misunderstood the situation. It was telling in the final chapters to hear about the regret from his jailors and just how much empathy he inspired in people.</p>
<p>It was and is a chilling take away for me.</p>
<p>The other standout was the varied cast of characters that Erik wrote about. Each having their own motivations to create a feat greater than that of the worlds fair which had unveiled the Eiffel tower. It was American pride and more than that, it was a time when places like Chicago wanted to create a place that could capture the imagination of a generation. The scenes in which we find ourselves seeing a young walt disney or the first wrigleys chewing gum.
Just felt magical, like witnessing the seeds of small aspects of American culture first coming into place.</p>
<p>What else can I say. If you have ever wanted to hear real life stories of people in the 1890&rsquo;s, a time where cars weren&rsquo;t a thing. Where people were easily
missed and it was common place to accidentally die by trolly its a wild ride. Mix that with the audacious killings that Holmes performs and you
get a very vivid tale. Def made me look up pictures of the world fair and next time im in Chicago, id like to see if that little island is still around.</p>

<p>Doing thirty days of blog posts was a lot harder than I thought. The last couple days especially felt difficult, since I didn&rsquo;t have time to continue coding up any htmx examples or alpinejs or really much golang. Since, typically for those projects I spend a few hours coding and writing the steps back to the blog. But even more, finding things that I wanted to write about was difficult. So I&rsquo;m really glad that this is over and im happy that I tried.</p>
<p>Not going to lie. I did end up missing a few times through this month, id usually just have half an article written, or some terrible idea have baked that I just couldn&rsquo;t <code>git push</code> on. But end of it, I did finish writing all the articles and I did really enjoy the experience. But maybe a quick breakdown is in order</p>
<h2 id="what-i-liked-about-the-experience">What I liked about the experience</h2>
<ol>
<li>Blogging! I got to throw all sorts of spaghetti at this blog in terms of subjects</li>
<li>It was fun, stressful but fun</li>
<li>I got to improve the blog a little bit by upgrading themes and staying up to date</li>
<li>Made me appreciate my weekly writeup more, since that was an easier post</li>
<li>Forgiving myself when I missed a day. I&rsquo;m only human and these kinda challenges really remind you of that.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-i-didnt-like">What I didn&rsquo;t like</h2>
<ol>
<li>My spelling. Without doing more revisions, my usual bad spelling has infected the internet&hellip; maybe vscode has a more aggressive spell checker?</li>
<li>Forgetting a day, or forgetting to push up an article.</li>
<li>Not having a bucket of drafts to use for articles. I ran through ideas fairly fast and maybe thats not even bad?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Going to do this again next year and am going to again attempt the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">advent of code</a> coming out in a few hours. Maybe this year ill be able to get passed the fourth or fifth day. That challege wrecks me once it gets into matrix arrays and the like. But, here is hoping.</p>
<p>Oh, and thanks, if anyone reads this, hope you got some enjoyment out of the articles posted!</p>

I also enjoy teaching and leading engineers. So here comes my rant/opinion</em></p>
<p>Over the years, ive slowly been working on what I see as the pedigree of a technical CTO. Which, as ive been told, in person and online isn&rsquo;t what the job is supposed to be. The CTO is a leadership position and that if you are coding you are doing things &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;. While I don&rsquo;t disagree, as the amount of planning, meetings and ancillary discussions have overwhelmed my work life. I would posit that a technical CTO is still valuable as an engineering resource. But why?</p>
<h3 id="most-likely-your-technical-cto-has-been-through-the-gauntlet">Most likely your technical CTO has been through the gauntlet</h3>
<p>Maybe this isn&rsquo;t you, but maybe it is. You&rsquo;ve survived SOAP, Test driven development and a myriad of different challenges through your career and have come out the other side. Now, you sit in a meeting listening to the same tabs vs spaces conversations and its bland but you know what. You, probably, at one time cared and can provide a final directive. Even if that is that its a silly conversation and that we already have a style guide to direct the conversation.</p>
<p>But you have someone who you can relay on to keep these conversations from impacting the work and the bottom line of the organization.</p>
<h3 id="most-likely-your-technical-cto-knows-infrastructure">Most likely your technical CTO knows infrastructure</h3>
<p>Almost similarly to my first point. The technical CTO is going to have some ideas on IaC or getting the right island to start building your product/hut on. The engineering side of them are going to understand pricing across different PaaS offerings. They are going to know what happens when you adopt k8s to early and scaling. Its easier to get it right when you do it early in the process. Which also reminds me of</p>
<h3 id="technical-cto-understand-application-development">technical CTO understand application development</h3>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t going to have the &lsquo;force&rsquo; used on them when they see a slow app. Or let the fact you have no observability into your application. Or all the lovely day 2 operations work that the team hasn&rsquo;t deemed necessary. Well, as a technical CTO, you can just add that. You can go into the codebase an instrument. This doesn&rsquo;t mean your are an SRE, or a developer, you just know that its what you need to have confidence in your application on production</p>
<h3 id="so-much-more">so much more</h3>
<p>As a person who has spent a huge chunk of their career trying out different hats across engineering organizations, I love being a technical CTO. Its been hard as teams grow to actually do less and lead more. I miss the dopamine hit of finishing bugs and I enjoy getting into the weeds on a problem. But does mean im an impediment to my team. I don&rsquo;t think so, I look at the backlog, far down the line and work to find incredible hard problems that don&rsquo;t need solving right now and start cracking at them over time.</p>
<p>I love that I can sometimes put six months of effort into an issue thats moves our little product a little further. Its what you should do as a technical leader. You don&rsquo;t have to lose all those skills you&rsquo;ve built towards, you can still IC and lead. I personally don&rsquo;t believe them to be mutually exclusive.</p>

<h2 id="top-tier">Top Tier</h2>
<ol>
<li>Frieren: Beyond Journey&rsquo;s End</li>
<li>Shangri-La Frontier</li>
<li>Jujutsu Kaisen</li>
<li>The Kindgoms of Ruin</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking the lead is Frieren, just because the artwork and story both are a treat to watch. The pace reminds me of Berserk and I like that the unfolding of the characters is taking awhile. Its almost relaxing to watch and like I said, the animation is beautiful.</p>
<p>Second, Shangri-La is a fantastic SOA style plot, with a fun dark souls twist. Its a fun watch and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed EldenRing esk main character.</p>
<p>Third, Jujutsu Kaisen, its like Demon Slayer in the way the action screams off the screen. The only reason its down this far was due to my own bad taste.</p>
<p>Fourth, The kingdoms of ruin. This one was a shock for me, again, I think Berserk changed my life. The first episode was so good in how disturbing it was that I had to include it here. I have felt that the story is kinda falling a little after the third episode due to the plot and characters taking interesting choices. But either way the animation and the world is interesting and id love to read the manga at some point.</p>

For me it was a way to get through some of the harsher realities of the startup and time doing its thing. A usual entry starts with the date and day of the week. Followed by temperature and type of day, ie cloudy, windy, amazing. Then a quick jot of what I got up to that day. Then I allow for a section of just dumping, usually thats more rare but its nice to have the space. Finally I write one thing im grateful for, which has helped keep up with gratitude in general.</p>
<p>Recently I was able to get past a year of entries, which felt amazing. The biggest benefit has been the ability to spin back the year and see those entries matching the day. Which to be honest, has been both heart breaking and thought provoking. Heart breaking in that it was just a really hard time and thought provoking because even in the situation I was in, im here now. Still making entries, still trying to be a better dad and a better CTO.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for some random internet person telling you some advice. Start a journal and check-in with yourself. Tell some story or event that happened today. In a year, I bet you&rsquo;ll be suprised at what you wrote and how far you&rsquo;ve come.</p>

Had a great day with the kids and got them playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaRappa_the_Rapper">PaRappa the Rapper 2</a>. I remember playing it way back in the day, but it was fun seeing them laughing at the absolutly bizarre plot. Also ended up seeing <a href="https://hungergames.movie/">Songbirds and snakes</a>, really enjoyed the show. Viola Davis was especially good, I liked the fact she was playing the original game master. Although, its kinda like Saw, I love the story but sometimes I just want to watch the different methods torture, or in the hunger games, I wanna see the competition. If they ever end up showing a few of just the competitions through time (which i realize is not the point of the movies) - it would be great. See what happens when you grow up on &lsquo;The Running Man&rsquo; and &lsquo;American Gladiators&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Anyhoot, happy pre-thanksgiving for anyone reading this in the US. I&rsquo;m going to be making some fancy bacon wrapped olives because its an addiction of mine.</p>

But all those links aside, whats it like using something like <a href="https://github.com/makew0rld/amfora">amfora</a>? Its darn good and gives you all the hacker vibes. But seriously, its nice to just have a text based place to read and not have all the intensity of a full blown web browser. Also, if you like ansi art, its on fine display.</p>
<p>What is it about technology like the command line that is so good? For me its nostalgia and its familiar. I love magic of the command line, the way the blinking cursor is just waiting for me or anyone to take it for a spin.
If. You know the right words to use.</p>

<ul>
<li>Listening to the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/qanonanonymous">QAnon Anonymous Podcast</a> - little intense but facinating. They have smaller podcasts as well that look interesting</li>
<li>Relaxing night reading and listening to music</li>
<li>A bath after a difficult workday, had a screaming headache</li>
<li>Learning that &lsquo;Turn down for what&rsquo; came out nine years ago</li>
<li>Getting some chores done that id been putting off</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Every week has its own struggles. This week it was alot of peaks and valleys. Im glad to have gotten through those valleys but this week was definitely a week where I learned about the importance of timing. When to interject and to interject. Its been a hard lesson for me since I&rsquo;ve spent so many years head down and focused on creating things an an independent contributor. Now that ive got more of a voice, exercising it when the time is right, is important. So im thankful for the people this week that did speak up when it was important to do so. It humbles me and makes me proud to work with the people I do. So going forward, im going to do more, even if its just small to start.</p>
<p>Also, racking, I really like racking leaves. Something really nice about that activity.</p>

So its always good to have your tasks in there.</p>

While also throwing some docker into the mix as well, because why not. Im trying to reflect on basically ten years of technologies in those spaces between 2010 and 2020. Then trying laying out what my perceptions of that technology was from a person that truly wants to have optimal efficiency and security taken into account for their underlying application run time environments. So really this is a continuation of just that, where do we run an application and how is it better than another platform.</p>
<p>So lets just start there, where can you run unikernels in production:</p>
<p>Public Cloud Providers like GCP or AWS, using something like <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/unik">Unik</a> or using nanovms via <a href="https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/deploying-nanos-node-js-unikernels-to-aws">ops.city</a>.</p>
<p>then for wasm, you can run those in production</p>
<p>Using WASI, you can launch wasm server side tech on lambda, but so far its been lack luster since its tied directly to node.js rather then having its own dedicated runtime. Other implementations I looked at were <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/">wasmCloud</a> and seeing if that could be used in aws. This was a mixed bag since in 2022 the runtime for lambda was set to read only. In anycase, I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to launch a k8s cluster with wasmCloud, but hopefully ill get some credits to try that later this year.</p>
<p>wasmtime / wasmer also look like ways to run this stuff on gcp/aws. Again, haven&rsquo;t had a chance yet, but really looking into these as way to run wasm a an api/server kinda setup.
Also haven&rsquo;t tried out wasmer edge, which ive been really wanting to as well, since it looks like a fast way to get up and running to do this.</p>
<p>alright, well, its like the quote says, if you can do something in under two minutes just do it!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep trying and report back if I can deploy something on wasmer edge, because it would be very neat and I have a few projects over at vercel that would be great to move onto a wasm platform.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>I think I could do a better job at explaining the reasoning behind why you would want to actually use this technology as well as examples of how to deploy these technologies. So I may just start doing that in upcoming blogs since I feel that the number of topics is a bit to nuanced.</p>
<p>So, at a high level, unikernels are great and wasm is great and both kinda give similar benefits. While, I still think these are worth while techologies, at least for me, im still learning how to make the best use of these pieces of tech and need to carve out more time to write these things up.</p>
<p>So I will work towards writing more of that in this blog going forward.</p>

Even when VM&rsquo;s (virtual machines) became popular, its always been a fascinating way to carve out a box and serve applications securely. To that end, unikernel technology has been around for a long time, I believe around that 2k date. Its something that I have picked up and put down but thought id speak a little of it here</p>
<p>For me the first time i was introduced to unikernels was this website promoting LING (unfortunately they are no longer around), which was an implementation using erlang to create a unikernel that was set as an on demand instance of a website. So basically, you load a website, the website creates an instance of a unikernel serves a page and then that unikernel destroys itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://bneil.me/images/erlang-on-zen.png" alt="LING" title="Snapshot when LING was around"></p>
<p>I quickly went down the route of getting this kind of setup going, because the idea of a stateless website seemed really secure and possibly cost efficient. Think of on demand instances rather then long running VM&rsquo;s. Not running a server until the moment a request comes in is magic.</p>
<p>But to take a step back, when looking at unikernels I was trying to find a way satisfy resource efficiency. I&rsquo;m cheap. I like running my applications on only the most necessary components to run an application. That along with security, I love the minimal attack surface that unikenerals provide.</p>
<p>Kinda funny, at one time this website was running on a unikernel, based off the work at <a href="https://ops.city/">OpsCity</a>. At the time this blog was on Vultr, but I actually found my own requirement for this blog was underselling the overengineering I was doing to deploy things. Good on the folks at ops city, they were super helpful in me setting those things up a few years back.</p>
<p>As ive moved on, well not really, I&rsquo;ve been following the conversation around wasm which seems to share alot of the same goals as using unikernels, namely, resource optimzation and security via sandbox. Even docker to some extent. As unikernels achieve this on a OS level, wasm achieves this through different means, as a straight binary executable that you can serve via a server like nginx or invoked via node, apache, etc. Again, kinda similar to Docker except that its not run through a hypervisor.</p>
<p>Think I may have bit off more than I can chew on this topic, so I might just use the next blog entry to keep distilling my thoughts. Till Next time</p>

I truly enjoyed the client &lsquo;gitter&rsquo; for communicating to all the cool folks over in the scala ecosystem. So today I was having some nostalgia for my old friends and decided to fire up my old client. Rather than being
greeted with the usual rooms, turns out it was upgrade time! More than that it looks like it switched to a client called &lsquo;Element&rsquo; and that they now support matrix. I&rsquo;ve been following matrix somewhat just as an alternative to IRC, but again, I haven&rsquo;t jumped into
that tech in awhile but ive been following <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> which also allows a matrix client. Honestly, can&rsquo;t wait
for that to come out.</p>
<p>So anyway, got element installed and am attached to gitter.im. Saw some of the folks I remember hanging out with and im looking forward to reconnecting to some folks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Listening to my mom work with my cousins on selling our grandparents old place (its time)</li>
<li>Playing a game called &lsquo;Concrete Genie&rsquo;</li>
<li>My kiddo having her bday</li>
<li>Finding a poem the kids wrote me when they were younger</li>
<li>Having a moment to drink a beer with my wife and catch up after a long day</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a usually busy time of year, the kids activities are definitely back into full swing. Work has been very engaging and keeping me occupied. Feels much better than last year although most of that is just illusion. Its a startup so almost anything can happen in a flash. Which is good and terrifying, which I enjoy.</p>
<p>Its been a very frugal week. But nothing to be done about it. Sometimes unexpected expenditures come up and im happy we had the money to fix things, but its not a great feeling getting to that next paycheck.</p>
<p>In happier news we actually shared the movie &lsquo;Problem Child&rsquo; with the kids - Forgot that John Ritter was in that! So a little popcorn and a movie saved the day again. Or at least, the kids were exploding with laughter at some parts. Which was worth it.</p>

I think ive mentioned it in my other note articles on this blog but it really is a cornerstone of my daily routine. Well that is until a meeting happens. So this is more of a quick article on how to continue using a pomodora even with some or many meetings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Turn it off
Yes, you&rsquo;ve given up, the meeting is more important than your special little technique. Its a strategy that ive used, but unfortuantly, I forget. I forget to start up the timer again after my meetings have completed. So for me this is just a non starter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let it run
Does your pomodora have a bell? Welp, then if you do the 25/5 strategy I use, you are going to hear about it at least once throughout the meeting. Which is fine, its another reason to keep those zoom microphones silenced. But its also just better practice to modify the timer to something like 60/15. Which, you&rsquo;ll notice doesn&rsquo;t work great if you have a cluster of meetings back to back. However, this brings up the larger problem of meetings</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Who the fuck said, in this remote world, that meeting after meeting needs to start right on the hour. Its rediculas. I was in a cluster of meetings last week and I couldnt believe how odd it was to virtually hussle from room to room. I don&rsquo;t even remember it being this bad when I was working hybrid or in the office full time. Just feels like people expect you at the meeting regardless of what meetings you&rsquo;ve been to previously. End tirade</p>
<p>Ok, so a little off track today. What I was trying to suggest at the end of things is that if you want to try and use a pomodora while also listening in meetings, just set it up to hourly and use five minutes after a meeting to condense notes or go to the bathroom. Use those five minutes for you and the next meeting be damned. I don&rsquo;t know if thats popular or born from my own inate privledge or maybe its a weird thing to be an animal forced to sit in place and listen to other animals endlessly. I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know that once the meetings end and its back to solving a problem.</p>
<p>Pomodoras do a great job of reminding me to take a break. Blink. Do a pushup and then get back into flow.</p>

Which, is to say, our variant - where you pay for the full forty hours and only enforce thirty two total hours of actual work. This varient, to me, is the most human way to do things and I&rsquo;ll break down those reason briefly here</p>
<ol>
<li>No one cares on Friday</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been many places where Friday was just an ass in seats policy implication. No one wants to push to production. No one wants to have a meeting. Lunch goes an extra hour and people just aren&rsquo;t fucking engaged. So why? Why force people to be in the office when they don&rsquo;t want to be. Why force them to hang out and send memes when they can be home (working if they want on projects they care about) or just taking time to enjoy their families. Or what a number of people do, schedule dentist/doctor appointments instead of using the other work days</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When you need people they&rsquo;ll show up</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing ive noticed is that when, we do need to push. People show up and they care and they try, because we, as a company gave them time. We respected their time, so when something broke off hours - its not an issue of coverage, its just taken care of. Thats something you don&rsquo;t see with over taxed engineering teams. You get crispy responses and while we still have a root cause analysis the next work day, we aren&rsquo;t dealing with have dead engineers.</p>
<p>I could find more bullets, and I probably should, given the number of times ive had to defend this cultural choice. But its deep in me, that part of me that just enjoys working without structure. Which I get to do, if I want on Fridays. I can spin up a microservice or I can go walk with my wife - I can go for a run and not worry im not in by 10am. I love it and I love giving that freedom to anyone who we employ. Honestly, its one of the few things in my life I don&rsquo;t mind defending - especially when folks hate it because we could be doing &lsquo;more&rsquo;. Well, sure, you can always have people doing more, but the thing is</p>
<p>That shouldn&rsquo;t be the fucking requirement. People need to be motivated, and what motivates someone more than by telling them they get some of their life back to work on what they want.</p>

This way of pseudocoing is one of my favorite activities when doing new feature development or when dickering around with new ideas.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>When I say Psudocoding, what I mean, is a process of writing comments in place of an actual program to inform what the application/feature will be before the actual code is written. This can include a process of journaling and mock code in comments, writing in a notebook designs and consideration and even writing documentation for the feature or application..</p>
<p>This way of pseudocoing is one of my favorite activities when doing new feature development or when dickering around with new ideas. The reason being, is it lets me sit with the idea like a designer. To really think about the inputs and outputs and generally understand the problem set before blindly tackling the issue.</p>
<p>Earlier in my career, the idea of TDD development came into popular practice and I remember just thinking. &ldquo;This is like pseudocoding but with more steps&rdquo;, because while I was building out tests, I wasn&rsquo;t actually thinking about what the structure of the solution was going to be. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about interfaces. I was blindly guessing at what inputs id want and what outputs id need. But, I can feel some confusion in those statements. As to why it would be all that different and ill explain.</p>
<p>The difference lies in the execution. So here is a quick example of some off topic coding I was doing earlier this week</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-gdscript3" data-lang="gdscript3"><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># I want to create a circuit breaker system for failover</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">### check out libraries that may have this already! (chore)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## first i need to understand what the breaker activities are defined</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">--</span> to many signups
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">--</span> to many requests
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">--</span> is this throttling<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">?</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## middleware considerations</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>global activities w<span style="color:#f92672">/</span> breakers
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> (x) <span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span> allow <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> deny activity
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So those first comments are the building blocks of what will eventually be a feature. While, it doesn&rsquo;t look like much, those comments will remain in my code until I have a moment to revise and push up the code into the remote repository.</p>
<p>Again, this all comes down to personal style, but I wanted to share a little of how I write code prior to cleaning things up. Since honestly, I love writing and this journaling helps me understand before I write any code. So maybe if you are like me and prefer writing things down before methods are written, doing something similar can help.</p>

<p>The Quote:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.&rdquo; ~ Carl Yung</em></p>
<p>Why it matters:</p>
<p>So often, at least in my life, its been an irritation. A small misunderstanding, between my world and another persons. Id say its a gap, but its more than that, I look at a person and im confused as to why they can&rsquo;t bend their thinking or accept the world. But its that, its my view of the world and I don&rsquo;t know why I would expect someone else to see their world any differently than how I see it differently. So its the feeling of irritation. Its a tell. Its a possible moment for me to grow and try to bend my own world view - be it empathy or just meditation, the act is important. Since the act is what will provide the insight, into whether their world is something I should be trying to explore or a missed understanding within my own</p>

<p>Other than that, it was a very busy week with Halloween. I ended up dressing like a mad scientist. But per usual, the goggles they did nothing.</p>

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Had a nice week that was largerly drawn out with meetings at work and a lots of journaling at home.
Wasnt able to meet the daily meditations sessions I wanted, but did get in more running which was
great. I&rsquo;m still reading the book &lsquo;Build&rsquo; from Tony Fadell and its almost impossible to read because
I want to write notes throughout. The ideas parallel so many of the things ive run into during my
stretch as a CTO and really calls to question just what you should be doing for a customer journey
for your application and product. Its a really great book and can&rsquo;t wait to do a larger writeup.</p>
<p>Other than that, its hard to fit a week into a few paragraphs, but the exercise is a fun exercise.</p>

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Was a really nice week out and I was able to take some advantage of it. Got the updated covid/flu combination on Monday so I was an anxious wreck because the last few times the shot had me feeling chills in no time. However, was suprised, except for a soar arm, I got away unscathed. Otherwise, it was just a heads down week at work and a pretty relaxed day to day. We did end up getting our family pictures done on Saturday - so that was alot of fun. The kids are growing up way to fast and im often reminded that there isn&rsquo;t a reverse switch. So all I have is now and Im doing my best to remember that.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>

It goes with the territory, and it can drive you up a wall. I know personally from having to watch production channels in slack slowly fill with issues that it can become a scheduling issue. When do we fix the issue? Whos impacted and why can&rsquo;t we just spend one sprint without having to do a hotfix. So without further ado, ill unveil to you all the way I personally score issues that come flooding in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about following A.W.S.H.I.T, get those calculators ready</p>
<h3 id="a-impact">A. impAct</h3>
<p>How many people is this bug/issue going to impact. Which is usually the quick gut check of the blast radius. For example, a login issue, where no one can enter the app, yeah, it has to be fixed. It needs to be fixed yesterday but now works. Add +/++/+++ depending on how many folks this is going to upend if things don&rsquo;t get fixed</p>
<h3 id="w-wizardry">W. wizardry</h3>
<p>What is the lift in terms of magic scripting that its going to take to fix the issue (or at least duct tape it). If the amount of the incantations are too much then it might need to wait. Add a &lsquo;+&rsquo; for a simple incantation, &lsquo;++&rsquo; for complex.</p>
<h3 id="s-stability">S. stability</h3>
<p>Is this issue the only issue? Or has this issue caused instability in the rest of the application. If the cure is worse than the disease it might as well wait until a better fix comes in. Otherwise add another &lsquo;+&rsquo; to the score</p>
<h3 id="h-hosed">H. hosed</h3>
<p>This is costing you not only customer experience, this is costing you money. Its like that scene from the &lsquo;princess bride&rsquo;, where you are watching the years coming off your Westly. Its not looking good. If your actively losing money AND customer buy-in add another &lsquo;+&rsquo;.</p>
<h3 id="i-insanity">I. insanity</h3>
<p>Your devs have been working really hard on these new features and then this bug happened. It was the best of times and then it was these times, these really awful times where flow becomes sludge. Welp, welcome to the insanity of releasing things out into the wild without perfect conditions. It happens. However, now you get to add a &lsquo;+&rsquo; if you know this is going to set back the schedule by having a dedicated resource lose out on future development for sanity now.</p>
<h3 id="t-testing">T. testing</h3>
<p>Hey, works on my machine. IF the bug is critical and the fix needs thorough testing - add another &lsquo;+&rsquo; since you just took a poor QA resource and now are having them work to ensure that the update won&rsquo;t cause a cascade of more work.</p>
<h3 id="scoring">scoring</h3>
<ul>
<li>0 - 4: Just toss it into the next sprint, its bad, but it could be worse</li>
<li>5 - 7: Again, not worth the distraction, next sprint</li>
<li>8 - 10: Now. Unfortunatly now is a good time to fix this</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision to fix or wait on fixing a production issues should be weighed against a lot of factors. The above acronym aside, it&rsquo;s still important to discuss the issue in full in a slack/matrix/irc thread. To document it through a five whys exercise or do any other due dilligence that makes sense.</p>

<p>Back in Febuary, I was going through some articles on <a href="https://social.coop">social.coop</a> a mastmastodon instance that describes itself as being <code>A Fediverse instance for people interested in cooperative and collective projects.</code>.
As im likely to do, I have been slowly networking and checking out all the culture and discussions from the instance to self inform and make myself a slightly more informed netizen. The content on the site is especially resonating since
I love cooperatives and have wanted to create a similar structure for myself and other developers in Colorado. Which, is in itself another rabbit hole but ill digress. I stumbled upon a really interesting looking
<a href="https://decentsocial.net/">descent social</a> that promised this idea of an <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unconference">unconference</a> which, at the time I hadn&rsquo;t known was a thing. Intrigued I read through the site
and realized that I had missed the party by a few days. Nothing seemed to remain from the event, no streamers or downed flipper zeros. Just a whole lot of nothing. So I decided to dig in.</p>
<p>First, I scrapped together what links I could find, which lead to a <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/0lAUPI1cwF7NaqBG7MBCoxgVPNWavIyaKGYk3pb9TZM/embed/present/">cryptpad.fr</a> sheet, full of links and schedules. Which, also explained the format, which like I said earlier was new to me. Personally digging the idea of having conferences so self driven. Using libera.chat and matrix was neat as well, I hadn&rsquo;t used matrix before so I was keen on learning what that technology was good for. So many IM platforms come and go its always neat to find another one. Im talking about you <a href="https://gitter.im/">Gitter</a> - I never understood why these technologies splinter so much and so far. But that could be its own blog article.</p>
<p>Second, i followed the dead link to a neat platform called <a href="https://www.meet.coop/">meet.coop</a> which looks like a really neat conference tool that would have cleaned house in 2020. So I ended up marking that down as possible software and kept moving on as I still didn&rsquo;t have any of the information outside of the schedule id found in that cryptpad.</p>
<p>Finally, I ran dry of the main site so I went over to google and started searching. One of the first things that turned up was a hackmd article from <a href="https://hackmd.io/@decentsocial">2022-12-09</a>, that lead to a github account over at <a href="https://github.com/decent-social">descent-social</a> which didn&rsquo;t have much. Looked like it was just the website that was being served at the top of this article. Hmm</p>
<p>So back to the google board. Using some other source control exact matching. I turned up a win on codeberg which is another gitea, forge, kinda repository of repositories. Seeing their <a href="https://codeberg.org/DecentSocial">codeberg</a> site was great and made me feel like I was onto something because in there was <a href="https://codeberg.org/DecentSocial/2023-02-notes">NOTES</a>!!!! Not just any notes mind you jekyll notes.</p>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/nhKW2pvXwI8mc" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/scene-park-unix-nhKW2pvXwI8mc">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>So I had notes and could finally attend the party but that was only the start.</p>
<h1 id="finding-atacama">Finding Atacama</h1>
<p>One of the notes, <a href="https://codeberg.org/DecentSocial/2023-02-notes/raw/branch/main/pages/atacama-anon-and-distributed.md">this one</a>, made mention of a mysterious speaker known as @hoody. This person went on to speak about SSB (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Secure_Scuttlebutt">secure scuttlebutt</a>) protocol and their drive to create something from distributed web communities.</p>
<p>Personally, having tried other network like Nostr, I was intrigued by the choices that this speaker had disscussed, specifcally I loved the idea that the platform was fully anonymous, stay on your phone, and seemed like a platform you could just jump on and off as ya pleased.</p>
<p>The one problem. Was I couldn&rsquo;t find a link to a beta of it at all.</p>
<p>So that started my next rabbit hole adventure, which was to find &lsquo;atacama&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rather then go through the steps above, id say a good amount of searching for that user brought me to a twitter user tag of <code>hoodownr</code> that had done a really neat <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hoodownr-game-of-discovery">indiegogo campaign</a> a few years back. Also found a patreon for that person, but it wasn&rsquo;t setup. Also ran into a dead end on <a href="https://github.com/oli0/Hoodownr">github</a>.</p>
<p>But, after putting hoodownr into the github search, I ran across a user of the <a href="https://github.com/hoodownr">same name</a> and while the account seemed barren except for a few repos. The about information had a twitter and what appeared to be a link to <a href="https://moderator.rocks">moderator.rocks</a>. So I intrepidly clicked the link.</p>

<p>Nothing says fun and excitement like a homepage on IPFS and an android package you have to trick your phone into downloading. Regardless, I was excited to see this and some of these descriptions brought to mind my own thoughts about bluesky, twitter, etc</p>
<p>Well, in any case I had found the project that I didn&rsquo;t know I wanted and have been using the very small android application to post small wins throughout my day. Its refreshing given all the new development into decentralized social platforms that this one seems to be small and has given this a lot of thought and really feels like its a labor of love.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it was a really fun follow breadcrumbs. Im really hoping next year to catch the meetup and see what other projects people are presenting.</p>

For fun and for this blog ill breakdown each of the development steps as I run into them.</p>
<h1 id="the-origin">The origin</h1>
<p>Started out by looking at a few articles and even seeing what chatGPT would say in terms
of what the file structure should look like. Much like salt, ive been blown away with the variety
of approaches for golang file hierarchy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kevinhohl/petstore">Classic Implementation - PetStore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/quii/todo">todo with htmx spike</a></li>
<li>thanks <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/10z4z3j/go_time_266_is_htmx_the_way_to_go/">random reddit thread</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I left the chatGPT resource out of it because it kinda failed hilariously which may have just been the issue
of the LLM model ending in 2021. Who knows, but deep inside my breathing relaxes. For much like death, AI isn&rsquo;t taking
my job today.</p>
<p>I really liked the quii todo css style and the static file layout. Felt like MVC was making a come back, but I wasn&rsquo;t
as big of a fan towards moving everything into a domain directory so I kinda went and reworked the ideas from petstore
app.</p>
<h2 id="side-note">Side note</h2>
<p>Im also not super sure that Clover is going to be the end all goal. I started fiber with the prefork option to true which
meant that SO_REUSEPORT was enabled. Which is amazing, if you want to know more I think <a href="https://github.com/Fenny">Fenny</a> said
it best <a href="https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/180#issuecomment-590013111">here</a>, but that has some straight issues with
the way im working with clover as a data source. So I may need to see what client pooling is available for a critical section
that is basically a singleton.</p>
<p>So one alternative I thought about was using the Solid Protocol. This would allow me to save off the rss feeds and basically
get some free storage. It&rsquo;s mostly just a thought at this point but could be fruitful in the future.</p>
<h1 id="second-day">Second Day</h1>
<p>Going to start building the actual pulling and parsing multiple rss feeds. So look forward to more soon.</p>

Which of course meant a few nightmare induced nights from not drinking. Which is crazy to me, as I usually have a beer and two shots and call it a night. All I can think is its sugar withdrawal or some such. Anyway, I love dry January since it gives me some time to feel what the absence of alcohol is like on a normal monday through friday. I definitely feel I lean into having a beer after the kids get to sleep with the excuse that I deserve it or that I need help relaxing. It&rsquo;s great to take a step back and just live without it.</p>
<p>With alcohol out of the diet, those dreams I had when I was in my early twenties feel way closer. When I was nineteen, I remember just being so depressed because I was a pack a day smoker, drank nightly, got terrible rest and figured that was going to my life. Now that ive been able to balance my habits, it feels really refreshing to look back and just see how much progress ive made.</p>
<p>For, January, I also kept up with a daily journaling habit. This has been great in keeping my thoughts organized and keep myself on target. Honestly it started out more as daily journal entries with some bare minimum of what happened during the day. Then over time the entries started expanding into more personal issues about daily issues. Its been wild watching those thoughts leave my mental echo chamber. I don&rsquo;t really go back and expand on those points, but I feel its good they are out on paper. The only real issue with the entries is that I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable writing very personal things, I keep thinking like someone is going to read the entries and be like GOT YA. Which is funny as a forty something.</p>
<p>Other highlights from this month&hellip; Going to the Denver Zoo lights was pretty awesome. I love the way they do up the zoo and I am really just a sucker for christmas lights in general. The kids definitely are going to more activities again which is great, but is stretching us a bit thin in terms of time off during the weekends. Getting back to an in person D&amp;D session has been great (even though we most likely wont be doing 5e after this campaign). Oh, a big highlight this month was removing twitter and getting back into RSS Feeds. What a great change of pace to fulfill endless consumption of tech news. lol.</p>

Growing them, expanding them and more importantly proving them out.
Then, when coming to this website ive found it especially hard when it comes to figuring out what would be an interesting read.
So I typically end up reading more on the subject of coming up with subjects. Wherein I found the holy grail and as others before me
found this great strategy to ruminate on ideas. The all magical slipbox made popular by niklas luhmann.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been researching on the how now for awhile. The concept, that in itself feels simple has so many variations based on the person
interpreting the how. I was able to distill down what works for me digitally, but still find that it lacks a lot. So then I wonder, what
im doing wrong. Especially when it comes to my pride as a novice researcher. So this post is a little bit about that research and a little
about the steps im taking in my obsidian vault to merge concepts.</p>
<h2 id="the-stack">The Stack</h2>
<ol>
<li>Obsidian.md w/ sync option</li>
<li>Para Method</li>
<li>Bullet Journal</li>
<li>A voice recorder</li>
<li>Readwise</li>
<li>Pocket and Instapaper</li>
<li>Hypothesis</li>
<li>Zotero</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-things-work-together">How things work together</h2>
<p>The two work horses of the stack are going to be obsidian (digital) and the bullet journal (analog). These two are used in tandem to create a
unified input experience. Since my day to day is mostly spent behind a computer the bullet journal is a nice relief from staring at screens
however I have found that with both a good amount of dallying occurs. To be specific, there is a cycle of reviewing entries / fleeting notes
and crafting new ideas. Which is fine, thats kinda the point. At least its better than doom scrolling twitter.</p>
<p>The underlying structures for each medium are based off of different strategies. The bujo is going to follow the structure that was passionately
laid out by Ryder Carroll in &lsquo;The bullet journal method&rsquo;. While the structure provided to obsidian is modeled off of the PARA Method, laid out in &lsquo;Building a second brain&rsquo; by Tiago Forte, for folder layout then a slipbox in the resources area.</p>
<p>The slipbox is mostly following advice from &lsquo;How to take smart notes&rsquo; by SÃ¶nke Ahrens.  Which involves taking fleeting note. Which is a single page in the bujo or a &lsquo;Fleeting Note&rsquo; / simple
note in Obsidian. Then taking time at the end of the day to move them into a permanet note which
is then referenced by a map of content. Which is a index of underlying information around a subject
of interest. On a side, originally I had thought that the slipbox would be highly organized but its
really not. Its just kind of a mess of subjects that are intreguing that you tend to <em>want</em> to expand upon just because.</p>
<p>The last bit of the slipbox is the use of Zoterto for keeping track of where the information is coming from. Since splitting the reference note is supposed to remain independent of the permanent note. While this, I personally feel, only helps people doing more academic research ive tried to keep to the methodology.</p>
<p>The last bit, Readwise, Pocket, Instapaper and Hypothesis are all very fun and enjoyable to in creating a digital funnel. Basically as im running around the internet and pulling up information if its an article I don&rsquo;t have time to read I slap the &lsquo;Instapaper&rsquo; extension and <strong>BAM</strong> the information is ready to go next time I pull up the instapaper app. Aside from that instapaper has some unique in&rsquo;s from email sources that I use for various newsletters. Pocket I reserve for bookmarking simply because I needed a better bookmark tool. Then Hypothesis is great with grabbing random highlights across the web.</p>
<p>Readwise, is amazing. I&rsquo;ve been using it for around 455 days consistently now and while I disagree with the amount of &lsquo;Catcher and the Rye&rsquo; quotes it keeps showing me the actually funnel into obsidian is very impressive. It basically works like this</p>
<div class="center-it" style="  text-align: center;">

    Pocket-->Readwise
    Instapaper-->Readwise

<h2 id="the-daily-practice">The daily practice</h2>
<p>So having setup Obsidian using the aforementioned PARA method and having the bujo setup. The daily practice is usually to do the following in the morning</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on the pomodoro</li>
<li>Create daily note in obsidian</li>
<li>Create the bujo daily note and check any forgotten tasks</li>
<li>Take the notes from the bujo transfer to obsidian daily note</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that these steps don&rsquo;t use any slipnote methodologies and thats because the first focus of the day is on tasks. The slip box is used for developing ideas and expanding them which should happen through the day but isn&rsquo;t explicit.</p>

It was a slow reveal behind the eyes of an artificial friend
named Klara. Whose innocence and observations creates a truly delightful narrative. We start with Klara inside a store
waiting to be purchased and interacting with other artificial friends. What struck me first just the genuine
curiosity that Klara showed towards her world and how that was a rarity in her kind. Eventually her observations grow
and will inform her throughout the book. I don&rsquo;t want to give much away but just say it was one of the best books ive
read. It was simple to read but I kept finding myself re-reading chapters trying to ensure I didn&rsquo;t miss anything.</p>

<p>When going through the process of implementing <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a>
I found the process to be a little challenging. However, I would imagine most of my issues
were due to having a static site. Lucking, I found some really excellent examples of people
who had set things up and also used hugo!</p>
<p>So for those looking to for some help, I found <a href="https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-theme-refined/-/tree/master">kaushalmodi</a>
and also <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2021/02/integrating-webmentions-into-hugo.html">integrating-webmentions-into-hugo</a>
to have an excellent partial to follow. Mostly using the getJson function from hugo. The only
real gotcha was remembering to use <code>hugo serve --ignoreCache</code>.</p>
<p>So as for receiving webmentions, all done and complete. However, the real fun was just starting.
When looking into how to actually send webmentions, it looks like I get to do some coding. My
approach is to use vercel as a lambda to activate a scan of my rss feed whenever I publish a specific
kind of taxonmy in hugo.</p>
<p>So I started with these steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Add custom rss field for if im mentioning anothers site, like a comment. I did this through creating an index.rss.html in layouts/_default</li>
<li>Create a new github project, I used this <a href="https://github.com/riccardogiorato/template-go-vercel">template</a> as an example for how to setup the vercel project</li>
<li>I signed up with <a href="https://upstash.com/">upstash</a>, so i could have a little cloud db. Since its only for saving webmentions it should be low maintenance</li>
<li>Started to psuedo code up the implementation</li>
</ol>

<p>The free navy. Finally given some room to govern, falls. It was a
wonderful exposition into how a careful story. Well crafted. Can
create a narrative that can form and hold an empire. That and rail guns
keeping your main foothold to said empire in check.</p>
<p>Bablyon&rsquo;s ashes was a fantastic addition to the expanse series. It was a
page turner. A beautiful tale of megalomania and revenge. Or just a fun
exposay of the &rsquo;emperor having no clothes&rsquo;. The highlights for me personally.</p>
<ol>
<li>Filip, his character ark in this book was fantastic. The slow realization of who
his father is. Really is. Was as heartbreaking as it was liberating when he finally
takes on the &lsquo;Nagata&rsquo; surname.</li>
<li>Bobby, im a sucker for a good rambo scene. So the attack in the slow zone was
especially fun. As the antonym scene from her being stuck in an airlock. Unable to
help anyone.</li>
<li>Peaches, finally gets some recognition outside of her body augmentations.</li>
</ol>
<p>All-in-all, ð great book and highly recommended.</p>

<p>Sometimes I read a book and I start laughing at just how bad things
keep getting regardless of the beste intentions of the characters in
the book. Having now gone through a few of these expanse books, I knew
that the crew of the Rocinante, were going to see wild things in the
through the gates. But I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine how entertaining the middle
of this book would be.</p>
<p>It was just a smothering of humans being the worst version of themselves, yet again.</p>
<p>Also the side plot of the scientist being attracted to Holden was great. I think
the author could have played with Holdens polyamorous upbringing a bit more just
given those sorts of relationships wouldnt have been super alien to him. But, it
was addressed so I give the author a :+1: for that.</p>
<p>Really fun book and really nice character archs for some short lived side characters.</p>

<p>Abaddon&rsquo;s Gate centers around the aforementioned ring. It&rsquo;s
existence bringing the whole of humanity towards it. Sure.
What could possibly go wrong.</p>
<p>Within minutes of starting this book, I was hooked, again.
I really can&rsquo;t recommend it enough.</p>

I was impressed by the world building and just wild adventure, in caliban&rsquo;s
war the character and story arcs are on a completely different level. From
a war breaking out in the solar systems only bread basket too running full
throttle towards a space mutant and even a kidnapping -
I was absolutely delighted.</p>
<p>All while introducing characters like Avasarala, a

who&rsquo;s mental health is threatened very early in the book.</p>
<p>This was just the best kind of escape.</p>

For me my favorite character was Miller, and I was enjoying the tug of what felt like two protagonists in a single story.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Really great world building, interesting plot and just enough tension to really feel like an adventure.
I was a little confused when reading this book at first since the prologue was really odd. That and the whiplash
we get as we are first getting introduced into the world that James Corey paints
for us.</p>
<p>For me my favorite character was Miller, and I was enjoying the tug of what felt like
two protagonists in a single story. Honestly, as much fun as it is to listen
to the free spirited Holden, it was nice to have someone as defined by the belt
as Holden is defined by his upbringing on Earth.</p>
<p>My friend had told me years ago to read this book and im glad I finally have.</p>
<p>What an amazing time and im looking forward to reading more from the expanse.</p>

<code>goose postgres &quot;user=postgres password=${TEMP_PGPASS} dbname=audit_dev sslmode=disable&quot; up</code>
I played around with that for a bit just because migration tooling is neat.</p>

<p>Now I just need to write the code for the migration of older audit records. So if any neat code comes up, I&rsquo;ll write it

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Decided that I wanted an audit db and service to help keep track of user behaviors.
Since I already have some in Redis, and some in Postgres I thought this might be a useful exercise.
The main thing id like to accomplish with this code is going to be a way to track events and break
them down by week/month/year per user and per company.</p>
<p>Im having some self debate about creating tables for the tallies or if I should just be creating
them on the fly using a query. I like the idea of the tally because it would be a place to easily
look that information up. Although if some error occurs it could possibly be inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="schema">Schema</h3>
<p>Deciding on a good schema, im thinking something like</p>
<p><em>audit table</em></p>
<ul>
<li>userId</li>
<li>companyName (i dislike using company id because then you have to look it up)</li>
<li>timestamp</li>
<li>event</li>
</ul>
<p><em>user tally table</em></p>
<ul>
<li>userId</li>
<li>companyName</li>
<li>Timespan - YYmmdd</li>
<li>event</li>
<li>count</li>
</ul>
<p><em>company tally table</em></p>
<ul>
<li>companyName</li>
<li>Timespan - YYmm</li>
<li>event</li>
<li>count</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-second-thought">On second thought&hellip;</h2>
<p>Maybe just using rds would be a better fit. The amount of scanning would be pretty awful. Ok, abandoning idea!</p>

<p>Oh, man took me a week straight, but I was able to create/find the living ship.
Was a really fun adventure up until the section where you have to track down a portal.
Since that was a bit of a hunt, and a half to figure out how to get to the Euclid galaxy
from the new galaxy I had just created from finishing the atlas path</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if using Hugo for writing notes would even be
applicable to my current work flows. Right now I usually just
use Evernote, but then I never really go into Evernote and
re-review all the things ive noted.</p>
<p>I keep feeling like there has to be a way to manage GTD, alongside
tools that im working with daily because seriously, the amount
of context switching in terms of apps/sites to plan any one project
seems crazy.</p>
<h2 id="current-setup">Current Setup</h2>
<p>Right now my usual task propagation is from vim into trello for personal
projects and pivotal tracking for professional projects.</p>
<p>Then while working on tasks  &lsquo;Be Focused Pro&rsquo; tracking pomodoro time iterations.</p>
<p>Notes are done either through vim, samsung notes or evernotes.</p>
<p>Bookmarking is handled from pocket.</p>
<p>But I really don&rsquo;t have any way to index ideas or sort through anything. So I keep bouncing around
all sorts of productivity ideas, bullet journals, more note-taking apps, things like GTD to try
and wrangle all the things. But nothing really sticks.</p>
<h2 id="what-works">What works</h2>
<p>I like how simple trello is. I like how simple vim is. I love markdown for note taking. When reading
articles on virtual gardens or second brains, it seems like the ability to search and structure data
is what makes the most sense. But does hugo provide that, kinda, I think id probably need to restrict
the frontpage from displaying notes. But slugs should do a good job of keeping projects together.</p>

My last attempt was that Danny Devito Quote generator that I believe was working fairly well.</p>
<p>Although, having said that it really isnt at the point id like it to be. I originally wanted an &ldquo;always sunny in philadelphia&rdquo;

<p>Looks like ive got my night planned.</p>

<p>On looking through the documentation some more, looks like its as easy as signing into <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmentions.io</a>
and signing in. Although I still have to figure out how to retrieve the mentions and report them on this site&hellip;</p>

<p>It all started with finding a webring. I hadnt seen one since the mid 90&rsquo;s and the accidental stumbling upon one
was almost magical. If you&rsquo;ve never had the pleasure, a web ring was this piece of tech that was largely social.
It was a way of finding genres of websites you were interested in and daisy chaining between them. Largely this was
before google owned search and the &rsquo;little&rsquo; guys like alta vista were king. In anycase since the advent of google
pwn of online search ive seen fewer and fewer webrings when organically surfing around the internet.</p>
<h2 id="indie-web">indie web</h2>
<p>Turns out, that web ring was also a movement that had started as far back as 2014, so being the hipster that I am
I started digging into movement. Stumbling across concepts like POSSE and digital gardens I became enthralled and a
little jealous. Its been years since ive worked on my own brand, or my own digital vision. So seeing that a movement
had sprung up that fosters that sort of growth was really something.</p>
<h1 id="on-being-creative">On being creative</h1>
<p>Ive been posting poetry and creative writing under a shell name now for over a year. Its been a way to relax when writing
and not worry so much about writing under, well, my name. Since &lsquo;my name&rsquo;, is associated to being a cto for a startup.
Associated with friends and family. I dont know, its just a really freeing experience to not worry about the people who
can associated you with your writing.</p>
<p>Im guessing that most people can understand that. Its what used to make travel so appealing. Nothing better than rolling
into a new pub and grabbing a drink with people who don&rsquo;t know your name. Its an experience in self building.</p>
<p>But the downside, I now have over a year of work under a shell name. I won&rsquo;t be able to move those over to this account
without someone figuring that out. But, who knows, maybe there are enough people in the world now that one person writing
poetry isnt a big deal. Maybe its just some latent elementary angst.</p>
<h2 id="this-blog-meets-indie-web">this blog meets indie web</h2>
<p>To that end, im going to be trying to incorporate more of the concepts ive been reading about from indieweb then writing
about those implementations here.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I was reading through the docker documentation for docker registry and ran into this curious idea of nondistributable
artifacts and how that related to some layers that are proprietary. Which got me thinking about how I could setup
my own non distributable layers.</p>
<p>So looking into <code>microsoft/windowsservercore</code> I figured since those had some foreign layers I could take a gander at what
was in the manifest which made particular layers &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;. But on pulling the image to my linux box I got the helpful error
of <code>image operating system &quot;windows&quot; cannot be used on this platform</code>. Which makes perfect sense since containers depend on
the host machine for the proper resources.</p>
<h3 id="next">Next&hellip;</h3>
<p>So, the search begins for finding some more information around foreign layers and how to specify them within a manifest,
dockerfile or registry&hellip;</p>
