December. Been a long month of not much work consulting wise. Ended up having to really focus in on some new paths forward because im not going into January without something lined up. So with that nervous energy I ended up making a silly emoji finding game called [Emojihunter](https://emojihunt.fly.dev/). I plan on making some more improvments to it and add a blog article. but its been a fun aside. Anyway, back to hunting for work and finding emojis. Happy holidays!
