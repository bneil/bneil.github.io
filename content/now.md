_Last Updated: {{< updated >}}_

Little late to the update this time. Can't believe its already October ðŸŽƒ. Been enjoying the cooling weather along with trying out a few new programming languages. But mostly just been heads down working. Going to try and get a few updates going. Always feels like the first things I forget when I get busy are updating this site.

ðŸ‘‹ If you are reading this, maybe head over to my [resume]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) if you want to play some basic space invaders and maybe we can collab sometime ðŸ˜Š
