Ahh, love April in Colorado. Nothing like a sprinkle of rain, a tiny bounce of hail and sunshine. Im very much enjoying the month and have spent a lot of time this month reaching
out to folks that can help me find more clients. Its been a challenge for sure. Also looking
to spend more time in appreciating the family. Very thankful for them.

Also if you are reading this, maybe head over to my [resume]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) if you want to play some basic space invaders and maybe we can collab sometime ðŸ˜Š
