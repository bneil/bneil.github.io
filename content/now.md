January, Glad to start a new year, was a bit of a stretch at end of December. However got to see some family and its hard not to enjoy the holidays. Just something special about that time. So since its the new year, going to make it a year long commitment to adding a few articles here a month on something relevant im learning or reading about. 

ðŸ‘‹ If you are reading this, maybe head over to my [resume]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) if you want to play some basic space invaders and maybe we can collab sometime ðŸ˜Š

### Last Update
December. Been a long month of not much work consulting wise. Ended up having to really focus in on some new paths forward because im not going into January without something lined up. So with that nervous energy I ended up making a silly emoji finding game called [Emojihunter](https://emojihunt.fly.dev/). I plan on making some more improvments to it and add a blog article. but its been a fun aside. Anyway, back to hunting for work and finding emojis. Happy holidays!
