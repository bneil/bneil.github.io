Nothing like updating the now page half way through the month. Always cracks me up. Its been a rough start to the month just due to me stepping down as CTO for Compliable. Had to get my resume in order, continue
reaching out to folks and really think hard about what is working vs what is not working in my life right now. 

Also if you are reading this, maybe head over to my [resume]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) if you want to play some basic space invaders and maybe we can collab sometime ðŸ˜Š
