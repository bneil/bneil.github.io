## Legacies and Strategies

The free navy. Finally given some room to govern, falls. It was a
wonderful exposition into how a careful story. Well crafted. Can
create a narrative that can form and hold an empire. That and rail guns
keeping your main foothold to said empire in check.

Bablyon's ashes was a fantastic addition to the expanse series. It was a
page turner. A beautiful tale of megalomania and revenge. Or just a fun
exposay of the 'emperor having no clothes'. The highlights for me personally.

1. Filip, his character ark in this book was fantastic. The slow realization of who
his father is. Really is. Was as heartbreaking as it was liberating when he finally
takes on the 'Nagata' surname.
1. Bobby, im a sucker for a good rambo scene. So the attack in the slow zone was
especially fun. As the antonym scene from her being stuck in an airlock. Unable to
help anyone.
1. Peaches, finally gets some recognition outside of her body augmentations.

All-in-all, üëç great book and highly recommended.
