Got started on this book from a recommendation from my wife and wasn't disappointed. Devil in the white city by Erik Larson 
goes into two pivotal events of the early
twentieth century in Chicago. One is the creation to execution of the 1893 worlds fair and the other being the serial killings of H. H. Holmes. The two events intertwine
during the creation, dedication and closure of the worlds fair. A fascinating read and while the horrific murders performed by Holmes 
work as a shadow to the work done to create that spectacle. It touched me and the individual accounts of the fair were just
an amazing process to go through with the authors masterful help.

To speak to that darker shade from the book, Holmes, the way he comes off is just so self serving. Its hard to understand the mind of a serial killer. The idea that
this person is just compartmentalized the hurt of someone else into either a sexual or primal need is impossible to empathize with. As I read, it was
almost a constant game to him, the stealing and repetitive lying - that even after he was caught it seemed like it was just more about how the world
had misunderstood the situation. It was telling in the final chapters to hear about the regret from his jailors and just how much empathy he inspired in people.

It was and is a chilling take away for me.

The other standout was the varied cast of characters that Erik wrote about. Each having their own motivations to create a feat greater than that of the worlds fair which had unveiled the Eiffel tower. It was American pride and more than that, it was a time when places like Chicago wanted to create a place that could capture the imagination of a generation. The scenes in which we find ourselves seeing a young walt disney or the first wrigleys chewing gum.
Just felt magical, like witnessing the seeds of small aspects of American culture first coming into place.

What else can I say. If you have ever wanted to hear real life stories of people in the 1890's, a time where cars weren't a thing. Where people were easily
missed and it was common place to accidentally die by trolly its a wild ride. Mix that with the audacious killings that Holmes performs and you 
get a very vivid tale. Def made me look up pictures of the world fair and next time im in Chicago, id like to see if that little island is still around.
