*spoilers*

Blake Crouch's really fun take on multiworld theory.

The novel follows the poor professor Jason Dessen as he comes off a cracking win of a datenight into a horror show of a plot twist. Something not quite right about a guy who is getting messed with by himself. Which I have to admit, the whole plot being turned by your own shadow self is something Jung would have enjoyed reading about. Personally loved the book for all the twists and turns and especially the ending with what I imagined to be a 'birds' esk experience of many Jason's just staring at him as the family choose to escape to another dimension. 

### My grips

Few are far between, the idea that one desicsion splits into another within a multiverse is just fun. I loved how those versions were hunting his dark shadow self for a long time. Oh, and just the not knowing if even the narrator was truly Jason Alpha, kept me on my toes. Because seriously, that was alot of duplicates. 

That said, great book! 4/5
