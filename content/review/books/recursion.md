*spoilers*

Blake Crouch's sliders esk "Recursion" novel takes readers on a journey through memory, time, and the very fabric of reality. 

The novel follows NYC cop Barry Sutton and neuroscientist Helena Smith as they grapple with a mysterious phenomenon called (FMS) False Memory Syndrome, where people suddenly remember entire lifetimes they never lived. The first few pages are amazing
in the way they grab you from a person about to jump off a high rise, due to a whole life they want to go back to. Really jarring stuff. The book continues by showing the invention of a particular device that is able to jump backwards in time but with
one of the coolest side effects devised. Like, I have enjoyed multiple timeline stories such as 'back to the future' but it was so satisfying having each attempt at controlling the timeline reverberated in the general populace of the book.

I was imagining myself as an NPC getting wrecked every iteration. I couldn't fathom the amount of pain those attempts to correct the time stream would put the general populace through. Very fun thought experiment that can stay on paper.

All in all, really enjoyed the read.

### My grips

The ending had me a bit vexed. Like I said earlier, at the start of the story Barry is investigating a woman who is going to throw herself off a building due to FMS. However the ending has Barry going to the original timeline, which I think would have meant he would have gone at the first 'nose bleed' that anyone in his direct knowledge would have known. What im saying is that how would Barry have the dead memory to go back to the original timeline, it was never mentioned that he was impacted from it. I guess if they had mentioned, 'oh and Barry a few months earlier had a nose bleed', I could have understood the ability, but as far as I could tell the only people with the original memories would have been those involved in the ION project.

That said, great book. 4/5
