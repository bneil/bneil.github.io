The way this book introduces its world is fantastic. It was a slow reveal behind the eyes of an artificial friend
named Klara. Whose innocence and observations creates a truly delightful narrative. We start with Klara inside a store
waiting to be purchased and interacting with other artificial friends. What struck me first just the genuine
curiosity that Klara showed towards her world and how that was a rarity in her kind. Eventually her observations grow
and will inform her throughout the book. I don't want to give much away but just say it was one of the best books ive
read. It was simple to read but I kept finding myself re-reading chapters trying to ensure I didn't miss anything.
