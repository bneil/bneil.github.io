I couldn't put this title down from page one. Where in Leviathans Wake
I was impressed by the world building and just wild adventure, in caliban's
war the character and story arcs are on a completely different level. From
a war breaking out in the solar systems only bread basket too running full
throttle towards a space mutant and even a kidnapping -
I was absolutely delighted.

All while introducing characters like Avasarala, a
head strong - tactical politician boss bitch archetype and Bobby a gunnery sergeant
who's mental health is threatened very early in the book.

This was just the best kind of escape.
