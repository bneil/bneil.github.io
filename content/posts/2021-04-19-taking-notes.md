## Hugo for note taking

I'm wondering if using Hugo for writing notes would even be
applicable to my current work flows. Right now I usually just
use Evernote, but then I never really go into Evernote and
re-review all the things ive noted.

I keep feeling like there has to be a way to manage GTD, alongside
tools that im working with daily because seriously, the amount
of context switching in terms of apps/sites to plan any one project
seems crazy. 

## Current Setup

Right now my usual task propagation is from vim into trello for personal
projects and pivotal tracking for professional projects.

Then while working on tasks  'Be Focused Pro' tracking pomodoro time iterations.

Notes are done either through vim, samsung notes or evernotes. 

Bookmarking is handled from pocket.

But I really don't have any way to index ideas or sort through anything. So I keep bouncing around 
all sorts of productivity ideas, bullet journals, more note-taking apps, things like GTD to try
and wrangle all the things. But nothing really sticks.

## What works

I like how simple trello is. I like how simple vim is. I love markdown for note taking. When reading
articles on virtual gardens or second brains, it seems like the ability to search and structure data
is what makes the most sense. But does hugo provide that, kinda, I think id probably need to restrict 
the frontpage from displaying notes. But slugs should do a good job of keeping projects together.
