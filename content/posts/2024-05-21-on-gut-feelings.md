## On trusting your gut
_or how to stop attending meetings that make you feel sick_

This is more of a personal article, so if that isn't your cup of tea, go checkout some other fun articles!

I've wanted to write about this subject for awhile, mainly because I feel its something I avoided so long while working at Compliable. 
I would get these terrible feelings of dread and anxiousness after meetings. The feeling of something like existential dread mixed with this
belief that whatever I was preparing to work on just wasn't what would benefit the startup the most at the time. It would often make me
upset to the point id lose at least a few pomodoro's trying to rationalize the feeling. Usually by saying that its ok to go into everyday
and have meeting after meeting. When I think, deep down, I know im not a person that likes working in that way. I derive value in my work
by the amount of effort I put in and no matter how many times a coworker would say 'meetings are work', deep down, I don't believe it.

A meeting can be a fine thing when used occationally to address an issue in process, fill out an OKR, do a myriad of other things. But having
an abnormal amount of meetings everyday, didn't make me "feel" like I am useful. So my gut was right in a way. After I stepped down earlier
this month and noticed that as ive been working with other clients and haven't been forced to attend an endless stream of baby sitting meetings.

I feel better, but also realize that I should have set better boundries or stopped attending those meetings. Sometimes I think rather then
communicating just how awful those meetings were making me feel, I kept attending. I kept allowing those situations to drain me and leave me
to feel that anxious bristling feeling. 

Recently, ive also been noticing that same gut feelings for these clients ive been taking on via consulting. Some, make me feel super invigorated while
others give me that very specific feeling of dread. I can't really explain it except to say, I think ill be cutting a few out sooner rather than later.
Because I can't keep going with this pit in my stomach. I just can't.
