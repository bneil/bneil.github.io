## Trusting Your Gut: The Key to Fulfilling Work
_or how to stop attending meetings that make you feel sick_

Have you ever found yourself dreading a meeting, only to leave it feeling completely drained and uninspired? I've been there, and it's not a pleasant experience. In fact, it's one of the main reasons I recently stepped down from my last role.

Working in an environment with an endless stream of mandatory meetings was slowly sucking the life out of me. I would get this terrible feeling of anxiety and existential dread leading up to these gatherings, and no matter how much I tried to rationalize it, I just couldn't shake the belief that they weren't serving me or the company well.

The thing is, I'm someone who derives a deep sense of purpose and fulfillment from the work I put in, not just from attending endless meetings. And while my coworkers would insist that "meetings are work," I could never fully convince myself of that. In my gut, I knew there had to be a better way.

So when I started feeling that same knot in my stomach while working with certain consulting clients, I knew I had to make a change. I realized that I needed to start trusting my instincts and setting better boundaries - even if it meant cutting ties with a client sooner rather than later.

Because here's the thing: that gut feeling, that intuitive sense of unease, is often trying to tell us something important. It's a signal that the situation at hand may not be aligned with our values, our strengths, or our overall well-being. And when we ignore those signals, we end up feeling drained, anxious, and resentful.

But when we listen to our gut and make decisions accordingly, something magical happens. We start to feel more invigorated, more inspired, and more fulfilled in our work. We're able to pour our energy into the things that truly matter, rather than wasting it on meetings and tasks that leave us feeling empty.

So if you're someone who constantly finds yourself dreading certain work obligations, I'd encourage you to pause and really tune in to that gut feeling. What is it trying to tell you? Is this situation truly serving you, or is it time to set some boundaries and make a change?

It may feel uncomfortable at first, but I can assure you that the payoff is well worth it. By trusting your intuition and aligning your work with what energizes you, you'll not only be more productive and effective, but you'll also experience a newfound sense of joy and purpose in what you do.

And isn't that what we all want, at the end of the day?
