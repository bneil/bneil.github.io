## Highlights

- ordering some pizza late with the kids
- watching some blue jays chase off a squirell in the tree outside my office window
- hearing about the adventures at second and charles. turned out 20lbs of kids books was worth about a dollar a pound
- having some whiskey watching cycling youtube videos
- playing some pictionary games with coworkers

### Takeaways

Was a really nice week out and I was able to take some advantage of it. Got the updated covid/flu combination on Monday so I was an anxious wreck because the last few times the shot had me feeling chills in no time. However, was suprised, except for a soar arm, I got away unscathed. Otherwise, it was just a heads down week at work and a pretty relaxed day to day. We did end up getting our family pictures done on Saturday - so that was alot of fun. The kids are growing up way to fast and im often reminded that there isn't a reverse switch. So all I have is now and Im doing my best to remember that. 

That is all.
