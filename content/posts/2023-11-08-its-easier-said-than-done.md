I spent a long time thinking about what I should be writing for today and tomorrow. So this entry is just going to be a quote and a quick description of why it rings truth in me. 

The Quote:

*"Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves." ~ Carl Yung*

Why it matters:

So often, at least in my life, its been an irritation. A small misunderstanding, between my world and another persons. Id say its a gap, but its more than that, I look at a person and im confused as to why they can't bend their thinking or accept the world. But its that, its my view of the world and I don't know why I would expect someone else to see their world any differently than how I see it differently. So its the feeling of irritation. Its a tell. Its a possible moment for me to grow and try to bend my own world view - be it empathy or just meditation, the act is important. Since the act is what will provide the insight, into whether their world is something I should be trying to explore or a missed understanding within my own
