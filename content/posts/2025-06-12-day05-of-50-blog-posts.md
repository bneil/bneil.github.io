## Day 5: What is the most memorable job you've held?

Easy enough. My most memorable job was one my father gave me in the summer of 1996. I was presented with a few tons of sand/dirt that had been moved from a sewer trench – not exactly the glamorous of summer gigs most teenagers dream about, but it would become something far more significant than I could have imagined.

The job was deceptively simple in concept: take a wheelbarrow full of dirt, walk to the end of the cliffs, dump the dirt, repeat. Day after day, load by load, until every grain was relocated. I started each morning around 7am when the air was still cool and the world felt fresh with possibility. I'd work steadily until noon, when the sun became too intense and my energy started to flag. After taking a few hours off during the peak heat – usually spent in whatever shade I could find, gulping water and trying to cool down – I'd return around 2pm and push through until 5pm.

During those long hours, I really got into the rhythm of it all. There's something meditative about repetitive physical labor when you surrender to it completely. Load, walk, dump, return. Load, walk, dump, return. Your mind starts to drift and wander while your body falls into this steady, dependable cadence. The wheelbarrow became an extension of myself, the path to the cliff's edge as familiar as the hallway in my own house.

More importantly, I had my trusty bright orange Sony Walkman clipped to my belt – that miraculous piece of tech felt like pure magic in 1996. The weight of it bouncing against my hip as I walked became part of the rhythm too. I would constantly flip between the local FM station and a Weird Al tape that I'd probably listened to a hundred times already. The contrast was perfect: sometimes I'd be moving dirt to the soundtrack of whatever Top 40 hits were dominating that summer, and other times I'd be hauling sand while "Eat It" or "Like a Surgeon" played in my headphones, making me chuckle despite the sweat dripping down my face.

Those DJs became my constant companions in a strange way. I would have enjoyed the summer regardless – there was something deeply satisfying about the raw, honest labor of the work that I really connected with. But what made it truly special was this ongoing storyline playing out on the radio. The local DJs were planning their wedding that summer, and it became this daily soap opera that I was completely invested in. They'd talk about venue planning, menu choices, family drama, pre-wedding jitters, the fact that the radio station didn't allow office romance (take that jim and pam) – all the intimate details of their relationship unfolding in real time between song sets (go 91x). I don't know why, but it made everything feel special, like I was part of something bigger than just me and my wheelbarrow and this mountain of dirt.

Sometimes life is weird in how the best jobs we have don't need to carry some profound meaning or grand purpose. They don't need to align with our career goals or look impressive on a resume. Sometimes the most memorable work is just moving dirt and refusing to give up, finding satisfaction in the simple act of completion, in seeing a job through to the end no matter how humble or unglamorous it might be.

There's something to be said for work that demands nothing from you but your physical presence and persistence. No complex problem-solving, no office politics, no emails or meetings or performance reviews. Just you, the task at hand, and the slow but steady progress that comes from showing up day after day. In our modern world of endless complications and digital distractions, there's an almost radical simplicity to that kind of labor.

The summer heat was brutal some days, and my hands developed calluses that took months to fade. My back ached, my shoulders burned, and there were definitely moments when I questioned whether this was really how I wanted to spend my vacation. But there was also something deeply grounding about it all – literally and figuratively. I was connected to the job in the most basic way possible, moving it from one place to another with nothing but my own strength and determination.

Took me about two months of daily effort, and I got it mostly moved. Mostly. I was a teenager after all, and perfection wasn't exactly my strong suit back then. But "mostly" was good enough for my father, good enough for the job, and certainly good enough for me. Sometimes that's all any of us can hope for – to show up, do our best, and get the job mostly done.

Looking back now, decades later, I realize that summer taught me more about work ethic and finding joy in simple things than any classroom or corporate training ever could. It wasn't just about moving dirt – it was about discovering that satisfaction doesn't always come from complexity or prestige. Sometimes it comes from a steady rhythm, good music, and the knowledge that you're exactly where you're supposed to be, doing exactly what needs to be done.
