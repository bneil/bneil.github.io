## Day 5, What is the most memorable job you've held?

Easy enough. My most memorable job was one my father gave me on the Summer of 1996. I was presented with a few tons of sand that had been moved from a sewer trench. The job was simple. Take a wheel barrel of dirt, walk to the end of he cliffs, dump the dirt. repeat. I started each morning at around 7am and went till noon, took a few hours off then usually 2pm to 5pm and continued. During that time, I really got into the rhythm.  More importantly, I had on my person a sony walkman, which was amazing. I would go between the local FM station and a weird al tape. It was great.

I would have enjoyed the summer, but there was something to the raw labor of the work that I really enjoyed. Also I remember the local radio DJ's got married that summer. It was this on going thing on there show and I don't know it made it special. Sometimes, life is weird in how the best jobs we have don't need to have a ton of meaning. It can just be moving dirt and not giving up until.

Took me about two months of daily effort and I got it mostly moved. Mostly. I was a teenager after all.
