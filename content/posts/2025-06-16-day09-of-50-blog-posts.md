# Day 9, Do you have a gratitude practice? Why or why not? What sort of things are you grateful for?

Yes, actually really enjoy writing in a journal and always putting a 'highlight' around what happened that day. Used to have a more dedicated journal once I first heard of the practice. It was really interesting to put to paper three things each day I was grateful for, like, easily something I was never really thinking about. So mostly, im grateful for small things. Walking to the mailbox, eating a few icebox girlscout mint cookies, or just walking with the kids and listening to them. Grateful for where I am and the people I surround myself with. Grateful to just exist.
