## Highlights

- Listening to the [QAnon Anonymous Podcast](https://www.patreon.com/qanonanonymous) - little intense but facinating. They have smaller podcasts as well that look interesting
- Relaxing night reading and listening to music
- A bath after a difficult workday, had a screaming headache
- Learning that 'Turn down for what' came out nine years ago
- Getting some chores done that id been putting off

## Takeaways

Every week has its own struggles. This week it was alot of peaks and valleys. Im glad to have gotten through those valleys but this week was definitely a week where I learned about the importance of timing. When to interject and to interject. Its been a hard lesson for me since I've spent so many years head down and focused on creating things an an independent contributor. Now that ive got more of a voice, exercising it when the time is right, is important. So im thankful for the people this week that did speak up when it was important to do so. It humbles me and makes me proud to work with the people I do. So going forward, im going to do more, even if its just small to start.

Also, racking, I really like racking leaves. Something really nice about that activity.
