## Day 3, Why do you like your favorite restaurant?

The easy answer would be the food. But if I was to dig a little deeper, its the feeling of space combined with good cheer. I like the fact that I can spend time with my family over a meal that ill enjoy. Its funny, I wouldn't say I have a favorite restaurant. But I have restaurants I enjoy dining at with the family. Usually that means the place has is relaxed, has a good menu and the people working there appear to be enjoying themselves.
