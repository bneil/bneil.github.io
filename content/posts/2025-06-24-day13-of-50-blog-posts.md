## Day 13, What societal problems is your region known for and do they affect you?

So the suburban world I inhabit gives me a slight buffer for better or worse, but im still impacted by issues. The ones I think about most would be topics around air quality, transportation and housing prices in general. Among them, especially as the summer starts to get on, and I start seeing air quality alerts - gets me depressed.  Between the wildfire smoke that seems to roll in every year now and those temperature inversions that trap all the Front Range pollution, there are way too many days where I'm checking the air quality index before deciding if I can even go for a run or bike ride. 

It's this weird modern anxiety - looking at a perfectly sunny day but knowing the air is gross. The wildfires have gotten so predictable that I almost budget for it mentally, like "alright, sometime between July and September we are going to have at least a week or two where everything smells like a delicious campfire and the mountains disappear behind this apocalyptic haze w/ a lovely red sun." And it's not just the big dramatic fire days - it's those code orange alerts where you're supposed to limit outdoor activity, but life still has to happen. 

I still need to mow the lawn, the dog still needs walks, and honestly, being cooped up inside for days on end because the air is unhealthy just adds this layer of claustrophobia to summer that didn't used to exist. Or reminds me of keeping inside during the pandemic (which did it officially end? I don't know if that was ever called). 

It makes me realize how much we take clean air for granted until it's not there. Which is also kinda funny given that I just heard Space Balls 2 is coming out in a year or so.
