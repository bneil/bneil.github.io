## Decided to take off for a little trip last weekend

So for my birthday this year, after watching a bike tubber, I decided to emulate this
persons tradition. Riding the number of miles you are turning. For me, that was a pretty
tall ask. However, after getting in some early spring rides, I did ok. I also lucked out
that the morning I left for the ride, it was overcast. But having ridden more than 40
miles, it got me thinking.

Why don't I try bike packing? Nah

Thought about it, and yeah, maybe. But looking out at my bulky camping gear, my back
started complaining....

Why don't I just pedal to a hotel?

So that got me really thinking. I wouldn't need to bring much except a change of clothes
which I could fit into my rear basket. I could kinda use that 40 miles as a radius from
the house and see what/where I could get to.

Turns out, that within that range was this cool place called [WeeCasa](https://www.weecasa.com/).

So with a goal in mind, I prepped and started off.

Took a couple of pictures

I have to admit, I was pretty good up until I accidently forgot about refilling my water
so that wasn't fun. Also I didn't realize the last ten miles or so would be at a 2-4%
grade. That combination of dehydration and hills, made me super happy to find a circle
K on the way into Lyons. Ended up buying a gallon of water and dumping a quarter of it
on my head.

So lesson learned about that. When I finally started feeling better, I kept on.

Finally got to the tiny house

It was a really fun trip, dehydration aside and the county roads weren't nearly as scary as id anticipated.
