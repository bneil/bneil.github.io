## Day 46: What is your all-time favorite story to tell from all the jobs you've held?

The one story that I like to tell was when I was working for Sony Online Entertainment.
They were the kewl kids that worked on EverQuest and EverQuest 2. It was a really big
deal for me, even though I was only working for the platform and marketing teams. But
that disclaimer aside, my favorite story was during a big refactor of the eq2 players website.

It was around 2am, only my boss and a QA person was around. With me being on the first floor
and QA being on the second floor. I was trying to fix this one javascript / jsp page, and
for whatever reason, I couldn't figure it out. But before pushing anything to production,
it had to pass QA on stage, which was taking about 10-15m via P4 and cruise control.

The funny thing about it was my boss and the QA dude Derrick was done. It was probably the
fifth time I promised it was 'fixed'. Finally, after another push to P4, five minutes passed
and I heard this scream, this stomp and 'DONT FUCKING TELL ME ITS FIXED, FIX IT'. To be fair,
they had hung out with me since 9pm and we were toasty. But for some reason, that frustration
was just what I needed to stop pushing sphagetti and finish the work.

Literally took me one more round and the stomp and cussing stopped, I apologized for not
checking my work more and it was just one of those lessons. I needed to own my own fixes
and not just force updates.
