## Day 10: What's Your Relationship with Physical Labor? Do You Enjoy, Accept, or Avoid It?

I really enjoy it. When I was younger, as I mentioned in a previous [post](/posts/2025-06-12-day05-of-50-blog-posts), I touched on this a bit. But honestly, I lose myself in physical labor. It's affirming. That's not to say I don't get anything from mental work; it's just that I think the raw expression of effort is a great feeling. It's one reason I've kept running into my 40s and really enjoy going on bike rides whenever I can.

If I can take a moment to complain, which I realize isn't great according to stoic principles, ie “Don’t be overheard complaining…Not even to yourself” but man, I want more time off. The company I work for saved me, and I feel a lot of guilt even thinking about taking some time off. But when I didn't have a job, when I was spending weeks stressing about how to afford my mortgage, I had the time. I didn't use it because I needed a job. So then I got a job, and now, thankfully, I have a little breathing room to live. I just want to ride a bike, to run, to push myself and find out what I'm capable of.

Life is a hustle—for me and for others. I just get tired. I get worried. We only get one spin on this rock, and I am so scared I'm going to miss it. Whatever "it" is, because I'm too busy working.

Physical labor? I think it reminds me of who I am. I'm thankful for it.

I've always found that there's a certain satisfaction in seeing the tangible results of my efforts. Whether it's a lawn I've spent a year on, a room I've cleaned, or a project I've completed, the sense of accomplishment is unparalleled. It's a reminder that I'm not just a cog in a machine, but a creator, an inventor, a human.

Moreover, physical labor has a way of grounding me. In a world that can feel abstract due to the amount of time im online, there's something profoundly reassuring about the concrete, the real. It's a break from technology and the endless stream of information that I consume.

So, do I enjoy physical labor? Absolutely. Do I accept it? Yes, because it's a part of life, a part of who I am. And do I avoid it? Never, because I know that it's in those moments of effort that I find a piece of myself that I can't find anywhere else.
