## Day 28, Do you have an /Interests page on your blog? What is on it or what would you put on one if you made it?

I don't! but I should write one up at some point. Interests are a little bit harder to think about then
then simply saying what are your hobbies. I guess my main interests are
- solving scale issues.
- automation, i love making easy to use build systems.
- refactoring, i love iteration.
- exploring, creating and understanding ideas.

Ive been really getting in zen, probably because im reading too much Alan Watts. But I don't know.

Id also say biking, I love going out for a ride and seeing parts of my neighborhood that id never seen before.
