## Day 7: Do you have any unpopular opinions or dislike something that many people like?

I believe birthdays should have been for pie and not cake. That most meetings could be a blog article in a wiki. That people complain about the things that they wish they could get away with. These are the small rebellions of thought that feel true to me, even if they swim against the current.

But in terms of dislike, I personally try to only 'dislike' things in the present. Letting those thoughts fall away, quickly. There's something exhausting about carrying grudges against abstract concepts or popular trends. Better to acknowledge the feeling and move on.

So as for disliking something that many people like.. maybe cars. I went to a lot of car shows as a kid. I didn't get it. Still don't. The discussions between two equally working engine blocks, I did like the paint jobs, but the discussions usually didn't feel very applicable*. It all felt like theater I couldn't follow. But I will gladly watch a thirty-minute YouTube video about a custom gaming rig that someone is proud of. The cable management, the RGB lighting choices, the careful component selection. So maybe we get variations of addictions, different flavors of obsession that speak to us for reasons we can't quite explain.

I mean, I try and take the kids to our version of Comic Con around here. Who knows the irreparable damage I'm doing, passing along my particular brand of enthusiasm. But isn't that what we do? We share what moves us and hope something sticks, hope they find their own version of wonder in the world.

_* as an aside, my dad did spend alot of time on cars, with fixing them up in the fifties and sixties so its probably just a club kinda thing. Who doesn't love some shared hobby._
