## Day 12, What hobbies have you had in the past that you no longer have? What happened?

The only hobby I can think of is Magic: The Gathering. To be honest, I just transitioned that obsession/hobby into different interests. I still really enjoy deck-building games and, if anything, enjoy them more without the mana drought. Also, times have just changed; I used to play in high school and college. But those people and those daily opportunities are no longer a available. But I am still happy to say I haven't gotten rid of the cards and still browse through my hoard when I get a chance. I really enjoy the art. There was something, how do I put it, almost 'garbage pale kids' about some of that 4th generation artwork.

Looking back, I can rationalize that MtG was more than just a game for me; it was a social activity that connected me with peers. The strategic depth and the creative aspect of deck-building were incredibly addicting, and I miss the sense of comradery that came with it. However, life has a way of moving on, and new interests dwarf old. 

I still hold onto that piece of my past, though, and every now and then, I find myself reminiscing about the good old days when I was deeply engrossed in the world. Looking through inquest magazine and spending nights, tweaking my deck to better my friends on the bus. idk, that person is still me, just not me anymore. 

What a fun prompt.
