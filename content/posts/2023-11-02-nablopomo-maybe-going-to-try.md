Saw this [post](https://youvebeenhooked.wordpress.com/2017/11/01/why-im-opting-out-of-nablopomo/) and didn't realize I was missing out on a writing challenge. So im going to try and come up with posts this month at a larger clip. So be prepared for some ideas that I can do on a daily basis. 

One thing that usually detracts from these sorts of challenges is that its so hard to just submit work that isn't 'perfect'. That whole quest for perfectionalism is a tough one. In the past ive used techniques like [done manifesto](https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2020/05/14/use-the-cult-of-done-manifesto-to-avoid-procrastination-and-perfectionism/) since just doing work feels good. So here we go again.
