## Day 37, Do you have any good or bad stories from your relationship with social media or Internet communities?

Ive had plenty of good experiences using the internet. More in the earlier days of twitter. It was fantastic
to finally be able to talk with people about new libraries and concepts online. Then digg and eventually reddit,
the vibrancy around coding. How it was making people more educated, how it was helping people find gainful employment,
and the hype trains.

Ruby on rails was so fun to watch and be apart of. When chef took off, that was really exciting.

Docker was crazy fun, I loved how the communities I was apart of started changing over night and embracing the technology.
