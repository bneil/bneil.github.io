## Highlights

- Listening to my mom work with my cousins on selling our grandparents old place (its time)
- Playing a game called 'Concrete Genie'
- My kiddo having her bday
- Finding a poem the kids wrote me when they were younger
- Having a moment to drink a beer with my wife and catch up after a long day

## Takeaways

It's been a usually busy time of year, the kids activities are definitely back into full swing. Work has been very engaging and keeping me occupied. Feels much better than last year although most of that is just illusion. Its a startup so almost anything can happen in a flash. Which is good and terrifying, which I enjoy. 

Its been a very frugal week. But nothing to be done about it. Sometimes unexpected expenditures come up and im happy we had the money to fix things, but its not a great feeling getting to that next paycheck.

In happier news we actually shared the movie 'Problem Child' with the kids - Forgot that John Ritter was in that! So a little popcorn and a movie saved the day again. Or at least, the kids were exploding with laughter at some parts. Which was worth it.
