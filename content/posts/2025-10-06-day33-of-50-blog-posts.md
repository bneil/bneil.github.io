## Day 33, What are five issues that have affected your political life?

I personally don't have bunper stickers. I don't relate my political beliefs to folks. Well
perhaps an exception to family that ask. But, honestly, fuck politics. Its devisive, for perhaps
the worst reasons. Or human reasons, I don't know.

So, anyhow, five issue that impact my political life.

1. Chill out. You. If you find your beliefs are impacting people. Chill. What are your beliefs pushing, most
likely they aren't what they need or ask for. Its a fact of life, beliefs !== actual problem.

2. UBI, universal basic income.

3. Media is broken, so truth, is now debatable. What is truth without fact, without validation, without substance.

4. Knowledge of history. Doesn't change our present. Life can be, as it is, with a healthy affirmation of whats occured (maybe it vibes).

5. Why isn't there a three party system. Its offensive to think, you can have millions of people behind coke or pepsi. Rediculas.

So, im not a political person. My dad, would, for so much of my life speak to the corruption in the system, so that
rings heavy in my own ears. But, having said that, I don't think people are very different. We exist. So we, as things
that are impermanite want to live comfortably, to live and work and die with respect.

So yeah, those five mentioned items, those are my issues that have impacted my 'political' impressions. Kinda weird, didn't
even have the ambience of a thankgiving turkey.
