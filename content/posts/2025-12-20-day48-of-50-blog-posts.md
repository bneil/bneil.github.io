## Day 47, Have you ever had a brush with celebrity? Write about It.

I'm pretty sure I met a band member from White Snake while on a smoke break
in Denver, around 2013. Not 100% sure, but the way he was talking and kind
of probing if I knew anything about the band had me thinking that maybe
he was part of the band. Really cool.

Otherwise, I did see Jewel perform before she got big at a coffee shop
in my home town. Didn't meet her or anyhting, but her set was pretty good.
