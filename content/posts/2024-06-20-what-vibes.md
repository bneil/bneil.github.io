Recently, I wrote about an article [on gut feelings]({{< ref "2024-05-21-on-gut-feelings" >}} "on gut feelings") and wanted to talk about things that ive been looking at that for some reason really resonate with me in terms of excitement. Like, while reading up on this technology I got into flow and was starting to hunt for companies doing work like this. 

- [0data apps](https://0data.app/) I went to this site a long time back. It's where I first learned about the solid protocol as a data store. 
- [remote storage](https://remotestorage.io) - per-user storage, who doesn't want to own their data
- rss... because I love rss
    - [https://ooh.directory/](https://ooh.directory/) is a recent directory I heard of
    - [https://indieweb.org/directory](https://indieweb.org/directory)
    - [http://superkuh.com/2023-02-02-feedlist.opml](http://superkuh.com/2023-02-02-feedlist.opml) [http://superkuh.com/feeds10.html](http://superkuh.com/feeds10.html)
    - like [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) except it's feeds instead of bookmarks
    - [https://personalsit.es/](https://personalsit.es/ "PersonalSit.es")
    - [https://searchmysite.net/search/?q=this+too](https://searchmysite.net/search/?q=this+too) <- search engine of bloggers, talk about 'finding the others'
- [FediForum](https://fediforum.org/) Its for people who move the fediverse forward

There is something with Nostr and ActivityPub. I want to start coding something using these technologies.
