## What has your relationship with music been like throughout your life?

My earliest memories were of being in a Dodge van, listening to a gray cassette tape player of George Thorogood and the Destroyers. But, given the question, "What's your relationship been like?" Hmm. I'd say that music is abundant. It's almost like a color, that it finds its way into your life regardless of your opinion of it. But to directly answer, that relationship has been a good one. 

I've enjoyed the music I've heard. I've had the pleasure of hearing many different kinds. It's a really cool thing.

I remember reading The Secret Cave: Discovering Lascaux, and while it was just a hypothesis (I think) in the book, the idea of music being so prevalent even in the Paleolithic era is a true lodestone for humanity. If music meant something to them, and even now means something to me, well, I think that says something. 

It's hard to answer something so fundamental if I'm being honest. 

My grandfather played in a jazz band. When he passed, he left a lot of sheet music in his wake, but I've never found a single CD of the music he played. Sometimes, I strain my memory for the few times I have heard him play jazz. He played an alto sax and I remember it being so loud. So dissonant. But it was in the band that his work gets lost in my memory. Which if I'm being honest makes me sad. I kinda wish I could remember more from his performances that I heard. Kinda feel bad I didn't have a sharper memory then. But, I try to forgive myself. It's not like you can take notes of a band playing songs in the middle of a summer night's heat. You just hold onto a fleeting tune. A whisper of a moment that passed.

Music holds a special place in my heart. I'm sure many people's hearts. It's a common place I think. Regardless of the genre. It's a tuning fork.
