## Day 32, What is your perfect record album?

This kind of seems like the article on [day 24 of 50 blog posts](/posts/2025-08-13-day24-of-50-blog-posts/) but ill get after it.
The perfect record album was this mixtape I had from earthday in 1996, specifically "95.7 FM San Diego: Collector's Edition 1996".
I just felt it was a really good album and had a nice mix of music I had never heard till that point, if your curious the fun lineup
was along the [lines](https://www.sdearthtimes.com/et1296/et1296s7.html) of:
- Joan Osborne
- SpaceHog
- Gin Blossoms
- The Why Store
- Dave Matthews Band
- Cowboy Junkies
- Primitive Radio Gods
- The Cranberries
- Hootie & the Blowfish
- Natalie Merchant
- Dishwalla
- Jewel
- Deep Blue Something
- Jars Of Clay
- Paul Westerberg
- Elvis Costello

I love a good mixtape, and this one was really good!
