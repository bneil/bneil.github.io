A big sync of time, even in a relatively small startup is the daily standup for agile teams. Personally I've been in small standups, ive been in large standups. I've been in remote 5am standups and ive been in afternoon, butt in seat after lunch standups. While the physical location is great, at least in recent years, going remote and being more receptive to a virtual standup has made the process much less time consuming. 

At the startup, we have a channel for internal communication, a bot happily splats out the following at 9am daily:

```
Daily Standup! Please reply with:
1. How are you feeling today?
2. What did you do yesterday?
3. What are you planning on doing today?
4. Any blockers?
```

I really like the simplicity of the ask, I love that I now have an archive to run through. All in all, for the past three years, no one has complained and its been great to have it added to the morning rituals.
