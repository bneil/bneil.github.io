Continuing on, lets go ahead and add [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) because doing reloads is lame. Also going to add a makefile because I feel like those two go together like beer and skittles.

First lets make a bin directory

`mkdir bin`

Then lets add the `.air.toml` file

```
root = "."
testdata_dir = "testdata"
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
  bin = "./bin/app"
  cmd = "go build -o ./bin/app main.go"
  delay = 1000
  exclude_dir = []
  exclude_file = []
  exclude_regex = ["_test.go"]
  exclude_unchanged = false
  follow_symlink = false
  full_bin = "./bin/app"
  include_dir = []
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html","gohtml","css"]
  kill_delay = "0s"
  log = "build-errors.log"
  send_interrupt = false
  stop_on_error = true

[color]
  app = ""
  build = "yellow"
  main = "magenta"
  runner = "green"
  watcher = "cyan"

[log]
  time = true

[misc]
  clean_on_exit = false

[screen]
  clear_on_rebuild = false
```

Now we can add in a simple Makefile, ive used [Taskfile](https://github.com/go-task/task) as an alternative, but really didn't get much out of it other then having everything in golang. Which is great but not really a requirement for this project. So here is the Makfile magic:

```
GOCMD = go
GOBUILD = $(GOCMD) build
GOCLEAN = $(GOCMD) clean
GOTEST = $(GOCMD) test
GOGET = $(GOCMD) get

MAIN = main.go

BINARY_NAME = ./bin/app

watch:
	air

build:
	$(GOBUILD) -o $(BINARY_NAME) $(MAIN)

run:
	$(GOBUILD) -o $(BINARY_NAME) $(MAIN)
	./$(BINARY_NAME)

test:
	$(GOTEST) -v ./...

get:
	$(GOGET) ./...

clean:
	$(GOCLEAN)
	rm -f $(BINARY_NAME)

all: build run

.PHONY: build run test get clean watch all
```

One question I always had back in the day with Makefiles was that .PHONY target, to put it simply when you mark a target as .PHONY, it's like telling Make that this target doesn't represent a real file or thing to build; it represents a task to be performed. So its always good to have your tasks in there.

Day 2 complete
