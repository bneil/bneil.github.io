## Day 2, On what subjects are you outspoken and on what subjects are you mostly mute?

Kinda surprised this would be the start of day two's questions. So lets get into it. I am outspoken mostly topics of biking infrastructure and the need for people to have balance in life. Even started a startup once with a friend with the hopes of just treating employees better than any other company. We did what we could as a startup while still doing everything for people that believed in our product. Honestly, was one of the best adventures of my life so far in getting to put so many fun ideas into play. Loved the four day work week and loved making sure people never had to stress for a healthy work/life balance.

Now mostly mute, probably anything political. When I was younger the idea of talking about policy, any policy, seemed to come easier with groups of people. But whether its human nature or the people ive interacted with. Discussing policy is never enough, it always leads into the over arching narrative of one political preference. Personally, if you know me, you know the policies I would choose. So I don't really feel the need to debate those online. So.. mute.
