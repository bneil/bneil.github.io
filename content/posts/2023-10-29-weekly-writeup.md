### Takeaways

Had a nice week that was largerly drawn out with meetings at work and a lots of journaling at home.
Wasnt able to meet the daily meditations sessions I wanted, but did get in more running which was
great. I'm still reading the book 'Build' from Tony Fadell and its almost impossible to read because
I want to write notes throughout. The ideas parallel so many of the things ive run into during my
stretch as a CTO and really calls to question just what you should be doing for a customer journey
for your application and product. Its a really great book and can't wait to do a larger writeup.

Other than that, its hard to fit a week into a few paragraphs, but the exercise is a fun exercise.
