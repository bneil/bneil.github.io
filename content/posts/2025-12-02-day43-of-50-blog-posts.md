## Day 43, What's the last trip you took? Was it fun? Why or why not.


The last trip I took was a bucket list trip, to the 'House on the Rock' in
Wisconsin. Not to get too into it, but it's a trip I'd wanted to take since I'd
first heard of this tourist trap of a destination.

To answer, was it fun? TL;DR, yes - it was amazing. It was everything I had
thought it was going to be. Which was as much the destination and the way we got
to it.

As for the why, I can't get into that without going into the trip as a whole.
So if you wan't to stick around for me clicking the projector ( or slide projector?
I haven't seen one in a looong time), and listening to the whole trip. Then hey!
Pull up a chair and check it.

For one, we decided to drive from Colorado to Wisconsin and that was a very long
and interesting drive (Nebraska, you are a cool state to drive through). We also
decided on the way to stop in Chicago, which was a new experience for me. Which,
to be fair, was also a really fun time in its own way.

The big thing with Chicago, which again, I literally know jack all about Chicago,
was we rented an Airbnb on the east side. In a very dense suburban environment.
The parking and general traffic was something I had never experienced in such a
compact area. Like, I literally almost got ridden off the road at a four-way
stop. The drivers are in general (to me) upset and aggressive.

Not to get into it, the transportation in the area is amazing and sketchy. The
waterways, train and buses were on point. Just the cars were crazy.

Anyhow, once we left Chicago and my driving was purified in the hellish waves of
people cutting me off and darting around me, I ended up almost getting a ticket
in Wisconsin. The cop was really nice as I was at fault going 20 over, but in my
sad sad defense, it felt like a completely different world between the two areas.

The drive up to the 'House on the Rock' was really fun as well. Lots of rivers
and lots of what reminded me of my drives to Bakersfield as a kid. I don't know,
lots of farmland and trees and clouds that made me want to pull over and chill.

But, the HotR was the highlight. We got there early in the morning, before they
opened but late enough the creepy gates to the property were open. The Halloween
decor was still on point given the season. We got the map and had a blast
exploring the three-hour self-guided tour.

Pro tip, buy all the tokens. You get back the money you don't spend at the gift
shop at the end. But this dude's love of animatronics would put a Chuck E. Cheese
connoisseur to shame. Just, banger after banger of weird and wild Americana. It
made me so happy to see so much whimsy in a place.

I really enjoyed it and it made me happy to see the kids run off and lose
themselves in a place like House on the Rock. A place that is just a little piece
of chaos and wonder all wrapped in an architect's ambition and a dreamer's
unapologetic vision.

Loved that trip, and wish I could wipe my brain and go again.
