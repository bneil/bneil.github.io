# Webmentions

So as I journey through the fun [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention), it looks like since im
just using github pages, I would migrate over to using cloudflare so I could play more with webworkers.
My last attempt was that Danny Devito Quote generator that I believe was working fairly well.

Although, having said that it really isnt at the point id like it to be. I originally wanted an "always sunny in philadelphia"
to regale my coworkers with. The end result of that project can be [found here](https://danny-devito.acererak.workers.dev/).

Looks like ive got my night planned.

## O_O

On looking through the documentation some more, looks like its as easy as signing into [webmentions.io](https://webmention.io/)
and signing in. Although I still have to figure out how to retrieve the mentions and report them on this site...
