## Day 22, Have you been to a memorable concert? What made it stand out to you?

My friend, an old coworker, once took me to a concert - I think it was 'death cab for cutie', I had been struggling with anxiety for a few years. His invitation to go to the concert was really out of the blue and I really wanted to go to prove I could. Not to side step this prompt, but I remember it was a time before I accepted my anxiety when it arose. So waiting, in the truck - drinking a beer, to try and calm myself was such a bummer. I don't like drinking, especially the way it felt that night. As a way to get myself, to just relax and accept I was going to the concert. I remember the concert and I remember the alcohol and I remember finally letting the music in. Letting the anxiety drift away. 

Looking back, that night was a turning point. Before then, my life was a tight loop of routine. I was trapped in a cycle of avoidance, scared to try anything new. But there was something about that concert that made me 'want' to break free. It was the first time I actively pushed against my anxiety, and it felt like a victory.  

That night, I was grateful for the friend who invited me, for the music that helped me, and for the small act of rebellion that became a memory I’m proud of. It wasn’t just about the concert; which was great, it was about the moment I realized that I could choose to be in a large public place with all the noise, and not crumble. Not go for a walk in the quiet. I could, live with my anxiety.
