Was putsing around on the debian 12 machine today and wanted to quickly find a program. Due to the start menu being so far away. After hunting online, I found this nifty open source tech called [alfred](https://albertlauncher.github.io) which has a nice file search and bunches of apps.

After installing its a little jumpy while typing but thats fun
