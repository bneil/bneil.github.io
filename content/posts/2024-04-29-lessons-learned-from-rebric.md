The last month, April 2024, has been a desperate time of calling friends, reaching out, networking,
and generally trying to find some space. Find some security. And not finding much, but finding some.
So during this slight respite, I thought id just reflect and bring my thoughts back to how I got here.
How I went from having a full time job building software with a good friend, working to become a better manager
and generally trusting things would work out if we kept building better software.

So, to start, I don't blame anyone. I believe most people work and act to the achieve the best results for
themselves and for the projects they care the most about. In fact, its how I usually try and find folks to 
work with. I find the people like me, who care alot about technology and getting things done. Who care alot
about people and want to create a humane place to get that work done.

To that end, working with my old startup was on point. People cared, we only ever lost a team member to our 
culture once, and out of seven years, I think that is a win.

Now no startup is perfect, some things I found this month on reflection were:

1. We didn't have a north star for what we built, even three years in you couldn't figure out what we did well. Whenever we did find that tagline or phrase, it changed. 
1. The whole of the organization didn't have a hierarchy.
1. The sales pipeline was a mess, top of funnel was never a priority.
1. The company was losing money on the team, which is what we expected in a VC backed startup, but it was a death sentence.
1. The CEO directly made commitments that other c-level suite folks disagreed with and weren't aware of until they were promised. You haven't felt more powerless until you hear what you're on the hook for.
1. Too many pointless meetings

Now, im **not** here to air out my dirty laundry from the past seven years and im certainly not going to do it from my
own one sided point of view. I just want to discuss those points on their own merits and explain how I think they 
helped put the startup on the back foot. Also, I just want it out of my head. So let's dig in.

### The company tagline

Just do it. Nike

Think big. IMAX

Belong anywhere. Airbnb

For us, 

Widgets are the bottleneck for your companies growth... We are 'the' Widget hub... We focus on getting Widgets done faster.

I realize that comparing yourself to Nike, IMAX, etc is not what you do as a startup. You find your fit. I've often heard it doesn't matter if you pivot 100 times or stick to a single
plan and execute. At the end of the day your only comparing lottery tickets. Those tickets can look vastly different depending on the leadership. But I, have a problem, with not being
able to solidify a goal after three years. I need to have something I can look to, to turn to, when I need to understand vision when no one is around. When im trying to figure out
the most important next step for engineering. I look left, look right and look in. Taking those internal mantra's and make them material. 

So is it the most important, no. But it helps keep all departments rowing the same direction. Something we really needed every day it was missing.

### Organizational structure

So I think this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-software-product-democracy-jose-r-gorchs/) from Jose Gorch, did a fantastic job in outlining the issues I saw with
the flat structure. Now mind you, thats just how folks work in engineering. We hold ourselves to the things we know best and trust product to do what they do best. So in essence by
trusting each other, we naturally achieve great things. However, this can breakdown. It does so when the people creating the product are second and third guessed by upper management.
That means, to be clear. You either hire someone as a product manager and let them deliver what their vision is. That when you tell them something needs to happen and it does or doesn't
you hold them accountable. Or yourself and remove the position and just do that job. 

It was painful for this lesson in particular. To see the inability for one team member to express, given all the process we put in place, to be successful. To time and time again
hear, we didn't deliver on the promises we made. That gutted me and it gutted the team and it really rubbed me raw because the only thing in life we have is time. Wasting it is 
a travesty, mostly for me. But also because I/we could have focused on something better

So is this about org structure, kinda. Its about communicating as an org, but its about leadership and what happens when that fails. I think flat orgs can work. But I don't think it works
when the people involved don't understand the bottom line. If its not clear from either top or bottom, you build the wrong thing. Thats the failure.

### Sales

If building features is the track, the train runs on money. Sales are the proud folks moving that rock into the stack. They, maybe more so than anyone is able to keep the lights on and keep
things going. This. Its my only point and aside from growing the company to fast feels like the biggest sin in a startup. You have no top of funnel, you have no next sales, you really have no
company because all the features in the world aren't going to give you a sale on a silver platter. 

More than that, you can't expect those sales to be 100% corp to corp. Or all enterprise, your sales strategy should be varied and there should be strategy. Or if not strategy a group of people
dedicated to out hustling your competition .

### Surprise, we are letting half the company go

Again, this one is another no brainer. Your c-level suite, needs to be involved in all the debate. Got it? Great. Now, what do you do after spending 3+ hours in a meeting pitching devils advocat. Finding consensus, going back to the drawing board, etc etc. What you don't do is take all that strategy and throw it out the window the first chance you get. As the face for the company. 
You don't hit all the points your c-suite told you not to. You don't 'read the room' and tell them them anyway. Because people listen to you as leadership.

They hold you higher for what you saw than a co-worker. 

If you give people a carrot after a stick, they want the carrot and you don't get to revel in the fact you found the money for that carrot by somehow coming in late game and finding the money
elsewhere. Or finding that sale and giving it to engineering when it was for sales. Its just bad form.

### Pointless meetings

I could write a novel on the amount of meetings that could have been an email. It's a trope at this point. But for some reason, they got so much worse near the end. Just the same meeting really.
A rehashing of the same dried bones melting in the tea. Doesn't matter how many times you look. The writing is on the wall. So why are we having this meeting.

A good friend once told me that, meetings are work. They are worth looking into the camera, taking physical notes and listening proactively. To engage in the meeting, because it's important. So
you know, I really liked that. For someone who, for years, didn't pay attention that much in meetings, I did. Which wasn't a light switch but it was good practice. To just keep my fingers off the
keyboard and try to paraphrase what the speaker is saying. Repeat it back and ask questions, even if they seem dumb, it never felt like the team made it out like I was saying something done. So if
nothing else, I really appreciated the idea, of not treating meetings like baggage but like something that is a formality of doing deep work.

You don't waste that time on pointless rehashings, you spend them with your team figuring out how to make hay into gold.


### Final thoughts

So, just to reiterate, I had a lot of fun in my last adventure. Looking for new ones all the time. Feeling a bit older now and feeling like I know better how to act professionally when the world around me isn't. How my strengths in listening, and in empathizing with people are getting stronger. But also realizing, that it takes adventures like the one ive had to become a more rounded person. So the bullets I wrote out definitely weren't all my learnings, but they would be better served out of me then in. So hope you enjoyed the read and if you find one that resonates with you leave a comment. Or just bookmark, 

take what makes you stronger and leave behind what makes you weak. 

Have a nice day.
