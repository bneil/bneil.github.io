Really was looking forward to today and I wasn't disapointed. Had a great day with the kids and got them playing [PaRappa the Rapper 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaRappa_the_Rapper). I remember playing it way back in the day, but it was fun seeing them laughing at the absolutly bizarre plot. Also ended up seeing [Songbirds and snakes](https://hungergames.movie/), really enjoyed the show. Viola Davis was especially good, I liked the fact she was playing the original game master. Although, its kinda like Saw, I love the story but sometimes I just want to watch the different methods torture, or in the hunger games, I wanna see the competition. If they ever end up showing a few of just the competitions through time (which i realize is not the point of the movies) - it would be great. See what happens when you grow up on 'The Running Man' and 'American Gladiators'. 

Anyhoot, happy pre-thanksgiving for anyone reading this in the US. I'm going to be making some fancy bacon wrapped olives because its an addiction of mine.
