## Day 20: How do you like to watch movies? Are you a theater goer, a streamer, or do you like physical media?

I like to see a movie once or twice every three months. It just depends on the kind of movie I'm looking to see. I really think theaters do a great job with their fantastic video and sound. But for the majority of my movie viewing, home is good enough. So for me, I've been very happy sitting at home and watching the latest thing on Prime or Netflix. This really vibes with how I was raised. We had a ton of VHS tapes. My parents copied so much from Blockbuster—in the walls that weren't walls, VHS tapes always hung there, usually with 3-4 shows on each one. So I got a lot of enjoyment from that growing up.

I'm not saying that my parents were the original Napster, but it felt like that as a kid. We even had all the VHS tapes cataloged in a word processor document with everything labeled. As an aside, growing up as an only child with a library of videos was special in its own way. I found a lot of comfort in those videos—in watching things on demand and watching them again, in spending time making popcorn in a 70s popcorn machine and vegging out most Fridays and Saturdays.

So yeah, not to wax too nostalgic.

that's me.
