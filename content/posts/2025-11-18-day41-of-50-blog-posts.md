## What is your relationship with your phone? Does it make you happy or sad? Do you get a new one frequently or infrequently?

I recently installed [Niagra Launcher](https://niagaralauncher.com/) to reduce the clutter I was experiencing with Samsung's One UI.
Honestly, I'd love to root the device and switch to something other than Samsung, but that's not currently an option. I also disabled
notifications for most apps, keeping only Duolingo, Messages, Email, Shop, and Google Maps. It was interesting to see how many apps
were upset by this change.

If we're speaking more generally, I upgrade my phone every two years. I use Google Fi and have been really satisfied with their service.

The question of whether my phone makes me happy or sad is complicated. On one hand, I love having a mini-computer in my pocket - that's definitely a plus.
On the other hand, I'm deeply uncomfortable with how much of my personal data is being shared with third parties, whether anonymously or not.
This brings me back to the classic dilemma of convenience versus privacy. The modern smartphone experience, where most things "just work,"
comes at the cost of my personal browsing habits and data. It's a trade-off I'm still wrestling with.
