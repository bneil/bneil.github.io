## Day 26, Are you retired or working? What are your plans for retirement?

Im working and happily employed. For retirement, I just expect to do more of the same,
sinec most of the things I enjoy, eg reading, riding bikes, eating are things that should
be sustainable.

Id like to travel, but I really like where I live as well. Id like to live in a smaller
place, like I did when I was younger, since there is a freedom in having less property
to maintain.
