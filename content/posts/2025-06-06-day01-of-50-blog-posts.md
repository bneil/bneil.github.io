## Introduction

So when I was looking through some rss tech, I stumbled upon the website [blogroll](https://blogroll.org/) and after clicking a few links, I found a fun blogging challenge called 50 blog posts in 50 days, that had been completed by [forking mad](https://forkingmad.uk/post/fifty-in-50). This seemed like a fun challenge, so I thought I could throw my hat in the ring and give it a go. So, to start, ill be following the [50 Ideas for Blog Posts](https://louplummer.lol/50-ideas-for-blog-posts/).

I'm going to aim for 50 posts in 50 days, but you know what, I think ill do try best.

## Day 1, A road trip you've taken that was memorable

So many road trips are memorable. That's one of the great things about a road trip, it's a break from the doldrums of daily life. But, if I was to be pressed on it, id say a memorable road trip from the past few years was definitely the trip to mesa verde. At the time, my kids were around five and eight years old. I had started the trip by presenting each a bear whistle. Since we would be going and staying a night or two in 'bear country'. Well, that was the start to the memory. A loud, ringing, painful start.


After pulling up to the Mc Donald's drive through, the sounds of those blaring whistles, we ordered and got the day of driving started. Before we got to far down the road, I remember having a flashback of reading the kids that berenstain bear 'car trip' story. Specifically that scene where the trees turn wild. That page, that image, has always been what this trip to mesa verde felt like in the outside tree lines as we made our way through the rocky mountains. 

The woods grew taller and the roots seemed to strangle the soil beneath. As the SUV glided through the mountains, I really enjoyed the scenery. But more than that, watching the kids put down the whistles and look out the windows. I could see from the rear view mirror them staring out and I found myself happy at seeing them absorb the world. It was a quiet moment. That was until, because of my observations, I past an off ramp and had to figure out what we were going to do next. 

Since if you haven't been in the rocky mountains, the coverage can be spotty at best. So the GPS had given out, and I got to figure out a new route. Time got away from me then, as I struggled to not say anything. While my wife, who has a key eye knew id messed up. It was about thirty minutes till we had started to get back on track and at that point the signs to Dinosaur Ridge had come into view. The problem being, that the detour id taken, had unfortunately meant we weren't going to be able to pull off and make it before they had closed for the day.

With a sigh, I remember driving to a small town. One that served ice cream. Pulling over, letting us all take a stretch. Filling up, and taking a moment enjoying the sunset. 

I remember staring off and being happy. 

It was nice to escape and get closer to the family. It'st those little moments, like grabbing breakfast, missing a turn or losing your mind at kids abusing whistles. 

Somehow, it all gets wrapped into a 'nice' memory, with a little ice cream, offset with puffy clouds and an orange sunset.
