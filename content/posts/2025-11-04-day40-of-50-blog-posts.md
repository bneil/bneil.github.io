## Day 40: What is the most scared you have ever been? Can you write about it?

The most scared I've ever been was probably the second year I was working at
the game company. We got off work late and it had been snowing. Since I was a
transplant, the car I was driving was only rear wheel drive. In any case, I
left work and the freeways were well plowed, but as I looked off towards the
off ramp I needed, I saw a truck that was horizontal to the freeway.
Instinctively, I pressed the brake, while at the same time realizing that was
the dumbest thing I could have done.

Immediately, my car started to fishtail. Then with NPR on the radio, my heart
started racing. Because even though I'd taken my foot off the gas, I was
heading straight for the truck. I thought, for a moment, that NPR would be the
last thing I would hear. As silly as that might be for a final thought, I
decided as the car veered to the left to give it gas. Which, thankfully,
caught the road and sent my car just around the truck and into a full spin.

I turned into the skid more and gave it more gas. I stopped spinning and went
on like nothing happened. My whole body was shaking and I made my way home.
Had a shot and a beer and cried.

Later that year I bought a four wheel drive vehicle and haven't had the same
fright. But when talking to older people, I often ask how the hell they drove
in the 70's with only rear wheel drive. What a scary as hell way to go about
the interstate.
