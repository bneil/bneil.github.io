## Day 4, What woman in your family do you most admire and why?

Thankfully, I've had a number of remarkable women in my life that I could look up to and admire. But, if I had to name one in particular, I'd say that I deeply admire my mom. She has been and continues to be a pillar of strength for me. Her dedication to her past work as a nurse and her unwavering commitment to her family have always been inspiring. In the past, she uniquely balanced her nursing life with her role as a mom, doing it all with grace and determination. Her kindness, empathy, and wisdom have shaped me into the person I am today. She always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and supported me unconditionally. Her guidance has set a standard for what is expected of me as a man, later enabling me to be a good father and show my kids love and guidance. It was a solid foundation to grow from, and she is someone I greatly admire.

Also, a shout-out to my wife of 20 years this May. You can't help but admire anyone willing to put up with someone for so long...
