## Day 4, What woman in your family do you most admire and why?

Thankfully, I've had a number of good women in my life that I could look up to and admire. But, if I had to name one in particular, I'd say that I deeply admire my mom. She was and has been a pillar of strength for me. Her dedication to her work as a nurse and her unwavering commitment to her family were very inspiring. When she worked, in the past, she brought a unique ability to balance her nursing life with her role as a mom, and she did it all with grace and determination. Her kindness, empathy, and wisdom shaped me into the person I am today. She always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and supported me. Her guidance gave me a watermark towards what is expected of me as a man. Which later made it possible for me to be a good father and show my kids love and guidance. It was a good foundation to grow from and she is a person I admire.
