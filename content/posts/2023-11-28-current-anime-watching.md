Again, running low on ideas for one post per day, so today im going to rank the anime im watching on [crunchyroll](https://crunchyroll.com)

## Top Tier
1. Frieren: Beyond Journey's End 
1. Shangri-La Frontier
1. Jujutsu Kaisen
1. The Kindgoms of Ruin

Taking the lead is Frieren, just because the artwork and story both are a treat to watch. The pace reminds me of Berserk and I like that the unfolding of the characters is taking awhile. Its almost relaxing to watch and like I said, the animation is beautiful.

Second, Shangri-La is a fantastic SOA style plot, with a fun dark souls twist. Its a fun watch and I've enjoyed EldenRing esk main character.

Third, Jujutsu Kaisen, its like Demon Slayer in the way the action screams off the screen. The only reason its down this far was due to my own bad taste. 

Fourth, The kingdoms of ruin. This one was a shock for me, again, I think Berserk changed my life. The first episode was so good in how disturbing it was that I had to include it here. I have felt that the story is kinda falling a little after the third episode due to the plot and characters taking interesting choices. But either way the animation and the world is interesting and id love to read the manga at some point.

## Mid

1. Goblin Slayer
1. A Returner's Magic Should Be Special
1. A Playthrough of a Certain Dude's WRMMO Life
1. Dr Stone


## Bottom (still good tho)
1. Bersek of Gluttony
1. My Daughter Left the Nest and Returned an S-Rank Adventurer
