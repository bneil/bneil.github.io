# Leviathan Wakes

Really great world building, interesting plot and just enough tension to really feel like an adventure.
I was a little confused when reading this book at first since the prologue was really odd. That and the whiplash
we get as we are first getting introduced into the world that James Corey paints 
for us.

For me my favorite character was Miller, and I was enjoying the tug of what felt like
two protagonists in a single story. Honestly, as much fun as it is to listen
to the free spirited Holden, it was nice to have someone as defined by the belt
as Holden is defined by his upbringing on Earth.

My friend had told me years ago to read this book and im glad I finally have.

What an amazing time and im looking forward to reading more from the expanse.
