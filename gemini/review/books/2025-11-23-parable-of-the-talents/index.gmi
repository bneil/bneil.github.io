## We are all Earthseed

So I finished up *Parable of the Talents* by the incredibly talented
Octavia Butler. Wow.

If you haven’t read *Parable of the Sower* or *Talents*, TL;DR: go pick
it up! I was surprised by just how engrossing the world is. The narrative is
told from journal entries of the protagonist, and I loved it. But I’ve
always been a sucker for that kind of retelling. *Flowers for Algernon*
was the first I’d read in that style. But anyway…

**Spoilers and much ranting ahead!**

## Let’s get into it

I’d say, “Fuck Marc,” but that feels too forgiving and shallow for such a
well crafted story.

Both leaders, Lauren and Marc, had faults, but I wouldn’t compare them
easily. Heck, I’d be hard pressed to even consider Marc a “leader.”
A pastor, maybe, but strict adherence to a belief system and neglecting
your own spirituality for comfort? That doesn’t make a leader.

His bland leadership was perfect for the god Lauren championed.

But! I really wanted to see his character and motivation, him and Lauren’s
duality and humanity’s wider purpose. I think those were the story’s pillars.
So I tried to think like Butler and Lauren did, trying to understand him too.

Side note: I was crushed by the end. His reconciliation with Lauren and that
empty handshake? Boo… hiss…

## A lack of purpose

I found the use of “purpose” as a driving force in the book very relatable.
Once basic needs are met, what did Jarret’s followers offer versus Lauren’s
hope? It was stark, tbh, we saw that in Marc and Lauren too.

When thinking of Marc, I wondered: what would loneliness mean to me?
What if I only ever wanted a vocation?

Purpose and safety which Lauren often spoke of hers as leading Earthseed; Marc’s
was becoming a minister like their father. It makes me wonder how the two
sides of each character darkly mirror each other.

That doesn’t excuse Marc’s inhuman act of hiding Lauren’s daughter. That
betrayal is beyond anything siblings should do to each other. Even trying
to empathize with his loneliness, I can’t morally justify stealing his
sister’s daughter for years, let alone his excuses.

But it’s his religion. If his religion, his northstar, his driving force,is
Jarret’s church and their beliefs? Maybe. From his perspective, Lauren is
a woman, and in his Bible, her speaking was blasphemy. She didn’t love her
child enough to join her rapists and his chosen belief system...

what mother wouldn’t do anything for their child?

So she deserved her cult and misguided life, leaving him alone.

## He had a rough road? I guess…

Even straining, I’ve had a hard time understanding it.

I didn’t lose my family to drug addicts or watch my siblings burn. Didn’t
have to preach, gain some moniker of respect, then lose it all, be collared,
and raped. So maybe Marc’s stunted growth and inability to see his sister
are warranted. But I don’t believe it. Nothing Lauren did justified it.
Tellingly, though, he needed her to be his enemy. the heathen sister trying
to lure him in. To give him contrast his own special story. Barf.

Lauren’s intensity in opening people up to new ideas and ways to live? I
found that intriguing. I even wanted a list of Earthseed phrases. Outside
of Zen, there isn’t a belief system that gives back as much as it takes and
respects the “changes” we endure. Politics, family, we could all benefit from
realizing change is normal, comfort isn't.

That change hurts and blesses us, but change IS constand that we should be prepared.

So I wanted to get my thoughts on virtual paper and say the two books were
really well written. Even if the second book  ended on such a hopeful yet bittersweet
tone.  Well done.

I’ll end with a quote from Earthseed, *The Book of the Living*:

```
There is no end
To what a living world
Will demand of you.
