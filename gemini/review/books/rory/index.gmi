# How Rory Thorne Destroyed the Multiverse



I'm a sucker for good dialogue. Thankfully this book delivers that in bountiful helpings.

Whether it's a fairies gift or the divine. very human. multiverse to which we are introduced. The plot is one that is
easy to imagine and easy to fall into. Enter Rory Thorne. First woman born to the house Thorne in 200 years. Not
weird at all, right? Well, that's what you get for not paying attention. It's soon after that fairies come to bestow
gifts on the young princess. Two in particular granting very special gifts. These two plot devices work. So well in
fact im suprised I haven't read anything like it before. 

For a book I grabbed on a whim from the library, this was a really fun read. The unique writing style. Almost
Terry Pratchetesk was a true treat.

Highly recommend
