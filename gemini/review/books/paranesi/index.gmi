# Piranesi



Really weird but really neat book. A book in which the protagonist and environment, were constant highlights. The
supernatural gift of navigating the maze of rooms, makes Piranesi a delight. Fugue state aside. The internal monologue.
Peaceful descriptions and endless ocean waves. Put me in a mood that I hadn't felt since I was younger. Listening
to the ocean ebb and flow. crash and dance.

Couldn't recommend this book enough. Even the ending pages were spellbinding. Tugging on slight anchors from one world
to another.
