## Never break the party

It's been really interesting in other expanse novels, the close
releationships. The comradery. Then here, you see people. People
that want to reconnect.

It was, at this point, my investiment into the crew of the Rocinate
was tested. I didn't want these characters to leave. To explore their
own backstories. But they did.

Then rocks fell and all shit went haywire. It was glorius.

Naomi's character ark in particular was so spectacular that I had on occasion
just had to stop gushing. She is the opposite of a character in a horror story.
She would literally stop playing and shoot the bad guy in the head.

Amazing and incrediably written.
