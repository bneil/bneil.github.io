# I Who Have Never Known Men Review



*spoilers*

Jacqueline Harpman attempt to make me depressed. It worked.

.... wow, really haunting view of a wtf of a start to a plot. The thing that I really enjoyed from the story as a whole was the skinner box nature of the child within. Her just straight, idgaf attitude towards the other prisoners and there qualms with remembering the good old days. It felt, really like some true grit and full of spiteful teenage angst. I mean, what a survivor character but what a horrific plot.

The days spent treking seemed laced with as much happiness as one could want. But the problem is many prisoners wanted more. It was that more that seemed to do them all in. Oof.

### My grips

None really, I tried to think about what the mysteries of the land were. Im guessing it was a planet mid terraforming. I have no clue what the guards were about. But I can appreciate the adventure in the young protagonist and yeah. It was alot of a book. 

That said, great book! 4/5
