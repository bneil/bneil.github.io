I'm burning through these books and this one was no different.

Maybe it's the instant draw. 

To characters whose only hope
of kindling a romantic hookup is belting themselves into 
a junker spaceship and hurling themselves through a gate
built from the reconstituted remains of Venus. 

But damn.

The flair seems so human, I could see it being real.

Abaddons Gate centers around the aforementioned ring. It's
existence bringing the whole of humanity towards it. Sure.
What could possibly go wrong. 

Within minutes of starting this book, I was hooked, again.
I really can't recommend it enough.
