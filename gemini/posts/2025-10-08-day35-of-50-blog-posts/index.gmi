## Day 35, What is your typical day like from the time you wake up until you go to bed?

Days vary depending on personal energy levels in the morning... lol

Alarm goes off at 6:30
* brush teeth
* wake up the kids
* read or just want in circles listening to audio book
* 7:30 to 8:00 is my dedicated waste time
  - NYT puzzles
  - Review RSS Feeds
  - Just something fun!
* 8:00 to 8:30 walk the pup
* 8:30 to 9:00 prep for work
  - very privledged to work from home so, i really take advantage

work day is on a pomodoro times, 25m on 5m off. That 5m off is a mix of
* read from kindle
* pushup
* pullup / hang
* quick meditation

_meetings are the worse as that means pomodoros end_

I wasn't a huge fan of atomic habits, but one thing that the author nailed
was micro habits and having the things you need in the area around you. So
thats what ive tried to do.

1st work ends around 5-5:30

5:45 - 6:00 is yoga or meditation (alternating)

Then dinner and family time. I harass the kids as much as possible whenever
I can.

After dinner, chores, and journaling, its usually 8:00 or so.

After 8:00, its watching shows, anime, etc. I like having the laptop out
since this is when I research tech I want to try and try to use different
tools. Nothing crazy this is all just sharpening the saw time.

Getting ready for bed is 10:30, just the usual of shutting things down and getting ready to get
after it again.
