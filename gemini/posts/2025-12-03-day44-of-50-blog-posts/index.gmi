## Day 44, Are you an exerciser? What physical achievement are you most proud of? Ever play any sports?

I love riding my bike, and I love running. Basically, if it's cardio I'm here
for it.

No crazy physical achievements. Oh, this one time when I was a teen and began
running a few miles I found this groove that was oddly perfect. Like something
more than a jog but not a full-out run, a place that I found I could just keep
going. It felt like a weird synchronicity with the world. Probably it was just
runner's high, but I ran for a long time that day and felt zero impact from the
effort, and I had run for a few hours.

Sports? Not really. I was a part of a swim team, bowling team and did archery for
a time. Each sport had its own things I really enjoyed.

With the swim team, it was the coaches who took it super serious. While I just
loved watching clouds while doing the backstroke. Had one coach who tried to
model me for their butterfly goto, which gave me some gnarly shoulder cracking
these days, but I did appreciate the faith they had that I could execute on
their direction.

For bowling, I really love the sound of the pins spinning and crashing when you
hit the pocket just right, with the proper amount of spin and force. A strike
that looks like a beehive imploding in on itself is, in its own way, a meditative
moment.

Then, archery was really fun. My grandad had left my dad and I a compound bow that
got my dad fired up to try the sport. Then once I had my own bow, it was something
which became part nature walk and part target practice. We would do these Sunday
archery events in San Diego, which took us walking through the bush in Balboa
Park. Honestly, some really great memories just crushing a 3D target range on an
early Sunday. Then, right as the last shot is lined up, the sound of bagpipes
rips across the early morning and tanks my shot.

So so so good.
