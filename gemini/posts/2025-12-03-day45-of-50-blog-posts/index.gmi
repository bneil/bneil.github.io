## What do you remember being a big deal to adults during your childhood or teenaged years?

This is a tough prompt. I think as kids we are so in our own world, that understanding
what is a 'big deal' can be a little hard to comprehend. I remember, my parents stressing
and telling me why, but those dots didn't always connect and especially decades later to
remember them.

But, I do remember, that when we moved from our old house to the new one. That they considered
it a big deal. Especially given that we had moved into my grandparents house after their passing.
It was a much bigger house and it was a different neighborhood. It also gave my parents a lot
of challenges, to their new location and mortgage.

I do think the 'big deal' for my parents for most of my life was just money. Making sure we had enough
and that we could make it to the next month and the next year. Even outside my family, I remember
adults always talking about vocation and salary.

Now, if we are talking more about entertainment, 'who shot mr burns' was classic.
