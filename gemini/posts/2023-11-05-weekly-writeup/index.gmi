### Takeaways

Was a really fun week. The NaBloPoMo thing is a little nightmarish. Been trying to keep up with just sharing interesting links and tid bits, but I keep forgetting to publish. So I feel like im missing content. Oh, well. In anycase I really do like the dedication to more writing, even if its a little sub par.

Other than that, it was a very busy week with Halloween. I ended up dressing like a mad scientist. But per usual, the goggles they did nothing.

Till next week ðŸ‘‹
