_In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on._
_Robert Frost_

Feel like ive been spending more and more time focusing on quotes like this. Almost like a koans, I find sitting with it, I find an understanding that no matter what the world goes on. Its a humbling and wonderful thought.
