## Day 36, What do you remember about your first computer and learning to use it?

So the first computer, was a 'zx spectrum' that you hooked into a television. It
came with a book of basic and a cassette drive. It was amazing, I was however very
young, so i couldn't read the words, and basically copied verbatum the symbols in
the book of basic to the keyboard letters. Very hunt and peck. But such is the fun
coding before you can read. I did have some success, like I was able to get a person
walking across a screen. Some very simple graphics, like fireworks, etc.

Later, I got into batch programming. Which might sound weird, but the help function
in ms dos was addictive. I could read the help, find commands, like CHOICE and start
creating tiny programs. So like a gateway drug, I started using it to create tui dialogs
and make fake screens using ansi graphics. Like faking programs I had no idea how to make.
Then after I got into pascal started making those real.

Was a really good time. I miss just geeking out on technical books with only a bbs or email
to get help. It was amazingly frustrating. I always wanted to learn more, to make more.

Those first few years, were incrediable rewarding in just how humbling the journey is.

Batch programming!?! come on.

Hell, I spent a few months in high school learning 'Hypercard' just to try and be something
close to seventh guest or myst. Just a little bit. But like I said, humbling and at the time
you just didn't know what you didn't know outside what you have access to.
