## What is your favorite food? Why do you like it? What is your history with it?

I don’t really have a favorite food. But if its before 11 a.m., I’ll 100% say omelettes. Its the sandwich of the breakfast hour and I really enjoy the myriad of ways you can make them. Recently I picked up a Tamagoyaki pan and have been making a lot of omelettes for the family. Its fun and great seeing the different ways I can make them. Personally love using spinach, feta and jalapeno. Little greek influence. 

Ive always been a breakfast lover. Usually my goto for a breakfast place is eggs over medium, sourdough toast and turkey sausage / hashbrowns if they have it. I like the simplicity and the fact ive had it so many times. 

As for history? I’ve always been a breakfast nerd. When I was a kid, my mom would make these massive, chaotic omelettes (or these really interesting potato pancakes) on Sundays. She’d throw in whatever was in the fridge—canned mushrooms, ham, cheese that came in a foil wrapper. I thought it was gourmet. Now I do the same thing, but with better knives and a fancier pan, maybe (just maybe) a little more focus on the ol ingredients. The difference is im not as brave as her. joking, im joking.

I will say, omelettes, burritos and sandwiches all have the same vibe. We are just packing a starch. Which is amazing and kinda neat when you think about it. So many thousands of years and so much of what we make is a variation of these common themes. I kinda wonder what master chiefs think about their craft. Like, at what point is the variation considered new. what constitutes 'new' and what is just an amalgamation of 'cube theory'.
