# Replaying No Mans Sky



# No Man Sky

Used to play the game a few years back and am starting to get back into it.

## Whats Great

Been really enjoying getting back into the game. After a few hours I even 
got to see a sand worm comes flying out of the ground. I was so used to just
being bored going from world to procedurally generated world that it shook me
for a second.

* New questing systems
* New treasure hunting games
* AI looks like it improved

### Living Ships

Oh, man took me a week straight, but I was able to create/find the living ship.
Was a really fun adventure up until the section where you have to track down a portal. 
Since that was a bit of a hunt, and a half to figure out how to get to the Euclid galaxy
from the new galaxy I had just created from finishing the atlas path
