# on-journaling



I journal every day. Its one of the few things that I have been able to keep up since last October. For me it was a way to get through some of the harsher realities of the startup and time doing its thing. A usual entry starts with the date and day of the week. Followed by temperature and type of day, ie cloudy, windy, amazing. Then a quick jot of what I got up to that day. Then I allow for a section of just dumping, usually thats more rare but its nice to have the space. Finally I write one thing im grateful for, which has helped keep up with gratitude in general. 

Recently I was able to get past a year of entries, which felt amazing. The biggest benefit has been the ability to spin back the year and see those entries matching the day. Which to be honest, has been both heart breaking and thought provoking. Heart breaking in that it was just a really hard time and thought provoking because even in the situation I was in, im here now. Still making entries, still trying to be a better dad and a better CTO.

So if you are looking for some random internet person telling you some advice. Start a journal and check-in with yourself. Tell some story or event that happened today. In a year, I bet you'll be suprised at what you wrote and how far you've come.
