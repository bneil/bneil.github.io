## Day 21: What kind of adventures have you had pursuing your hobbies?

Probably the most fun I've had was when I was getting into geocaching. If you have never heard of it, it's fun! Especially when the kiddos were a bit younger. Here is a link to get you started. But in any case, it got me into the habit of carrying around a small pen and taking notes when I was out and about. The general populace, known as muggles, are especially fun to navigate because it's not only about finding the cache of goodies — it's about doing it stealthily. This made it really fun for the kids, who were more than happy to look in bushes or under rocks, all while trying to appear like it's natural. Which, thankfully for kids, it is natural. Normally, when geocaching by myself, seeing a man in his forties attempting to climb, shake, or assault a tree is frowned upon. With a helpful kiddo, not so much. They are the perfect assistance.

I think the neatest geocache I ever came across was one that was hidden next to our local library. We had been going there for a long time as it was within walking distance of the house. It was a surprise to find out that it had a hidden cache right in the parking lot, inside a light pole base fixture. I think that was one of the reasons I enjoy it so much—just finding treasure in places I've taken for granted for so long. It kinda keeps the spirit alive and, for me, keeps that sense of wonder well fed.
