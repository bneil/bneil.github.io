## Day 25, Is there a special food from your region or heritage that you a particular appreciation for?

I grew up in a small town in San Diego, so I would say, the one food I miss more then most is a basic breakfast burrito from this place called Nico's in Ocean Beach. The area has lots of great places to eat and yeah, I could dip into my heritage, but honestly, the food I miss most is the food I used to buy as a teen. 

Man, I miss nico's.
