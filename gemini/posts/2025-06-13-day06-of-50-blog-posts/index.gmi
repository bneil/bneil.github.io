## Day 6, What is or was your relationship with people from your parent's generation?

When I was younger I thought it was pretty good. But I'll be honest, once I'd moved away from the parents twenty years back, the times I've worked with folks of that same age range has been limited. The ones I've worked with have always been great. We've differed on subjects that would make sense given the amount of social change during our lifetimes. But all in all usually good.

Looking back, I think there's something to be said for the patience they showed me when I was still figuring things out. Maybe it's easier to appreciate that now, with some distance and perspective. These weren't people trying to be my friends or impress me – they were just doing their jobs, sharing, living their lives, and somehow making space for a younger person who probably thought they knew more than they did. There's a certain steadiness to that generation that I find myself missing sometimes, especially in professional settings where everything feels like it needs to be disrupted or optimized.

I do hold fast that I don't think everyone was ready for the internet. 

Ready for echo chambers. Ready for the dissolving of classical media. I've personally tried to help, and point people towards RSS and other pieces of the small web, rather than pushing people towards more complex and toxic social media. I mean, not everyone needs to be exposed to, how did Bo Burnham say it, 'Anything and everything. All of the time.'

The thing is, watching my parents' generation navigate this digital shift has been both heartbreaking and fascinating. Some adapted beautifully, found new communities, learned to video call grandkids. Others got swept up in the worst parts – the conspiracy theories, the clickbait or negative algorithms, just the way social media can amplify every fear and grievance until it becomes a worldview. 

I've spent enough hours trying to explain why that some random Facebook post might not be reliable, or why maybe they don't need to re-share political memes that cross their feed.  It used to get exhausting, but I kept up the good fight because I remembered how they used to be the ones teaching me (im speaking more to my parents specifically at this point) to think critically about what I read and heard. 

Somewhere along the way, those roles reversed, and I'm not sure I (any) of us were ready for that.
