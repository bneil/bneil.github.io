# day47-of-50-blog-posts



## Day 47, Do you consider yourself to be an international person? Why or why not?
### If so, write about people you know or have known from other countries.

No, I hope to be at some point. But at the time of writing this, I haven't been international.
Will update this if that changes, later, though.
