## Day 38, How do you feel about writing? Is it often cathartic, fun, a chore?

I really enjoy writing. It's cathartic and fun, probably the most rewarding experence
ive had outside of my own inner monologue. Outside that, its an escape, I still
remember when I was in school. I used to write in my notebook for hours, pretending
to take notes while just writing stories or poems.

Grammer and whatnot be damned. Just writing has its own beautiful benefits.

Sometimes I wonder if I could draw better if I would have felt the same way I do about writing.
It's not as high a watermark. But, then ive read some terrible writing. Honestly, I don't
know how the majority of mine ends up. But I feel my writing could be worse.

So I have that going for me.

On an aside, I did often think after years of coding. That the introduction of so
much disjointed logic statements would infect the majority of how I wrote. But so
far, it appears a lifetime spent coding has mostly just impacted the way I speak,
and not the way I write.

On another aside, I think its pretty interesting when reading LLM written articles.
Have you all noticed the use of the 'Subject isn't just this, its this' kinda pattern?
Feel like im seeing alot more of that on medium.

Cheers.
