## What kind of decorations do you have in your workspace? What do they mean to you?

I have a mix of old linux cd's from the 90s (got to prove ive got old af xwindows that didnt give an f about your screen refresh).
Pieces of different cubicles from early in my career. Books. All the books. I find that when your on a zoom/meet call, one has to
have some books to prove you are locked in to the game. Im joking mostly, I really like those books. But my background has lots of
stuff and my desk has very little. On the old desk, its just
* a really kewl spinner thing
* my old zelda pin from 1984
* two test phones
* the kiddos mousepad (clutch)
* a bullet journal

I think like most workspaces, you try to find what makes the most sense. For me, the two main things I need to have are the bullet journal. Since I try
not to use obsidian.md when im in meetings. Feels better to transcribe thoughts afterwards. The second, is just having a clean desk. If im not careful
the ol desk gets busy with random stuff. So I try to keep it clean.

Hope that answers todays fun question.
