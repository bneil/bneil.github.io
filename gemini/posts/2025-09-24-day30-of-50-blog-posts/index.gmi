## Day 30, What is something you are passionate about and why?

Im passionate about writing. Throughout my life, its been the one thing I could turn to
that has helped me with speaking, programming and learning to be a better human. Its kind of funny,
with all the generative AI that has sprung up. Writing is one of the things that has been
a loadstone in my life. Ive always enjoyed learning how to communicate better through writing.
Through, blogs, journals and various art forms. Its fun and a passion that I realize will be life long.

I also love technology, like if you show me some shiny technology, im here for it. But in the same turn,
if you show me a note taking tip, or a better way to recall information - 'tools for thought' is what folks
called it awhile back, im just as engaged. But what I find funny, is just how simple it is to write.

Write it down and work it out. I find that to be powerful.

The process of writing is meaningful and well, im passionate about talking to myself.

Whether thats here, or on a scrape of extra notebook paper I always have on me.

Writing helps. Or, at least, that has been my experience.
