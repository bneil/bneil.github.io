# 50 Blog Posts in 50 Days (ish)



## The Challenge That Is Getting Away From Me. Lol.

I stumbled into this whole thing through some RSS rabbit hole that led me to blogroll.org, then to forking mad's completed challenge, and eventually to Lou Plummer's 50 Ideas for Blog Posts. The prompts looked fun, the challenge seemed doable, and I figured, "Why not throw my hat in the ring?"

Well, turns out maintaining daily consistency while juggling everything else is... challenging. Who knew? But you know what? I'm still plugging away at it, and honestly, some of my favorite posts have come out of this whole experiment.

## The Complete 50of50 Collection

Here's every post I've written as part of this challenge so far. Some are deep dives, some are quick thoughts, and some are just me rambling about whatever the prompt made me think about. That's kind of the point, right?

## What I've Learned So Far

Honestly? Writing regularly is harder than I thought it would be, but also more rewarding. Some days the prompts spark something interesting, other days I'm just trying to get words on the page. But that's kind of the beauty of it - not every post has to be profound. Sometimes it's just nice to capture a moment or a thought.

Take a look through 50of50 tag which has become my little breadcrumb trail for this experiment. It's been fun to look back and see the variety of topics and moods. Road trips, personal philosophies, random observations - it's all there.

If you're thinking about doing something similar, my advice? Don't worry too much about the timeline. The writing is the point, not the schedule.
