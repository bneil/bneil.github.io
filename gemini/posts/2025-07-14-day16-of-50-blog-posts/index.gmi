## Day 16, What things are easy for you to write about? What things are hard?

When it comes to writing, there's a fine line between being authentic and oversharing. While it's easy to pour out my thoughts on the world, the weather, or even the book, diving into deeply personal experiences is where things get complicated. There is a certain vulnerability that comes with sharing parts of yourself that you've kept hidden, and it's not always worth the risk of exposure.

I've found that the hardest things to write about are the moments that have shaped me, the failures and successes that have left indelible marks.

These are the stories that, while powerful, feel too raw to be shared with the world. It's not that I'm afraid of judgment, but rather that I'm protective of the parts of myself that are vulnerable. That were raw, that I worked on. 

There's a comfort in keeping stories to myself, a sense of control over my own narrative that I'm not ready to let go of.

Yet, there's a part of me that yearns to share, to connect with others on a deeper level. Maybe its an only child thing.

Writing is, after all, a form of communication, a way to bridge the gap experiences with another's understanding. But for now, I'll keep those personal stories personal and over time gain some confidence, and share, if i feel comfortable in the future.
