## Day 24: Write a review of your favorite album. What lyrics mean something special to you?

Alright, let's rip the band-aid off for this one. It's by far the 'Dumb and Dumber' soundtrack. While this selection sounds dumb, give me a second. When I used to go to Tower Records, I didn't have a ton of money, so finding movie soundtracks was a way to get a sample of music from a larger selection of artists. For whatever reason, the Dumb and Dumber soundtrack had so many great tracks on it that I have found myself listening to over my life. I loved the ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead, "Where I Find My Heaven" (what a great car ride song), and it was the first time being introduced to Green Jellÿ, via "The Bear Song." "New Age Girl" was great. I definitely wished it had "Boom Shack-A-Lak" which was in the movie but NOT on the soundtrack. Kind of wish I knew why...

Anyway, the album is a fun time and really is a time capsule.

The best song lyric was from "Crash (The '95 Mix)" performed by The Primitives, with the lines:

```
So what do you want of me
Got no cure for misery
And if I go about with you
You know that I'll get messed up too with you
With you
```

This still speaks to me. The "got no cure for misery" brings me back to being a teen, where you want to help, but you've reached a point where you realize you can't. It's impossible to fix someone else's problems, despite your earnest want.

For me, helping others was paramount, and with the line that "I'll get messed up too," it felt right—helping friends meant getting dragged into their drama and their pull.

That's it. Fun prompt.
