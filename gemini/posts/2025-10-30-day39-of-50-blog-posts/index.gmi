# day39-of-50-blog-posts



## Day 39, What do you like to read? Books, newsletters, doomscrolling, blogs, paper magazines?

I love to read books, YouTube, and blogs. I wish I had a better alternative to YouTube, but it's
still a great place to learn new ideas and technology. Even as much as I hate going onto ex-Twitter,
I still find myself coming back just because so much of the startup energy exists there. But, on
the light side of the force, books and blogs.

Books are by far the best way to turn off and relax. This year, I got into the Wayward Children
book series. The series itself was an amazing escape from the stress I was dealing with, and it
was eye-opening. That's why I push myself to read books with different outlooks. You get to
learn and become a better person through the safety of a book. In fact, months later, I still
think the story that involved the goblin market was perhaps the neatest trope I've read in a fantasy
setting. (Slight spoiler) What a great idea, that the world itself, which was someone's dream, could
be its own bubble universe with its own absolute rules.

Blogs are also great, in that I've read some amazing long-form content and I feel it's like reading
people talking off the cuff. Sure, I've read some blogs where the author will take time to study
and expound on a concept. But most blogs I follow are just everyday folks like me. People trying
to learn, study, and record the world in which they have found themselves. I think blogs are one
of the reasons I really liked Tumblr for so long. I still need to try it out again, but I like
the idea of a personal website just more than Tumblr. Even though I really miss the people on
there.

So that's what I like to read. Although shoutout to doomscrolling, that has been one of the crazier
things that is still possible on Lemmy, Mastodon, or Bluesky. I try not to, but sometimes, that
infinite scroll to the abyss is quite the draw.
