# NaBloPoMo-maybe-going-to-try



Saw this post and didn't realize I was missing out on a writing challenge. So im going to try and come up with posts this month at a larger clip. So be prepared for some ideas that I can do on a daily basis.

One thing that usually detracts from these sorts of challenges is that its so hard to just submit work that isn't 'perfect'. That whole quest for perfectionalism is a tough one. In the past ive used techniques like done manifesto since just doing work feels good. So here we go again.
