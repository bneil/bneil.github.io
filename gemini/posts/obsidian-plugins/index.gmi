# Obsidian Plugins



## Obsidian Plugins

As an update {{}}
I ended up biting the bullet and a now using obsidian sync. Just in terms
of ease of mind. Totally worth the investment.

So with that my current list is as follows

```json
[
  "table-editor-obsidian",
  "templater-obsidian",
  "dataview",
  "cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian",
  "obsidian-minimal-settings",
  "obsidian-kanban",
  "periodic-notes",
  "workbench-obsidian",
  "readwise-official",
  "quickadd",
  "obsidian-excel-to-markdown-table",
  "obsidian-outliner",
  "obsidian-projects"
]
```
