# took-a-day-off



Really was looking forward to today and I wasn't disapointed. Had a great day with the kids and got them playing PaRappa the Rapper 2. I remember playing it way back in the day, but it was fun seeing them laughing at the absolutly bizarre plot. Also ended up seeing Songbirds and snakes, really enjoyed the show. Viola Davis was especially good, I liked the fact she was playing the original game master. Although, its kinda like Saw, I love the story but sometimes I just want to watch the different methods torture, or in the hunger games, I wanna see the competition. If they ever end up showing a few of just the competitions through time (which i realize is not the point of the movies) - it would be great. See what happens when you grow up on 'The Running Man' and 'American Gladiators'.

Anyhoot, happy pre-thanksgiving for anyone reading this in the US. I'm going to be making some fancy bacon wrapped olives because its an addiction of mine.
