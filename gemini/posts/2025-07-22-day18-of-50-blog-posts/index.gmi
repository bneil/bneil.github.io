## Day 18: How Do You Feel About Alcohol? Is It Something You Enjoy? What Do You Like? What Do You Dislike?  

I enjoy alcohol, and I can understand how it’s been the **go-to depressant** for thousands of years.

If I’m being honest, it’s given me a respite from some bad anxiety I’ve had in the past. For example, I have this issue with stomach pains—like, I literally think I’m going to be sick sometimes after eating food for zero reason—but if I take a shot or have a beer, suddenly that brain I love (and that runs my life) finally takes a break from trying to think me into sickness, and I can enjoy my night.  

I also enjoy how socially accepted it is. I went on a bike ride a few days back, got to a nice venue, ordered a beer, and watched the sunset. It was the perfect ending to a long day pedaling. Lots of people were there drinking; it’s just a very social activity — or it can be. There aren’t many other drugs with that kind of universal acceptance.

It’s a monkey on your back. My best rule of thumb for drinking is: when I notice I *want* another one, I stop. Don’t ask me why I’m my own worst enemy. Don’t ask me how many times it took to learn that habit either. I just know that when I really crave another shot or beer, it’s time for water — and probably time to call it a night.  

Alcohol is simple, and it reminds me of when I smoked constantly. You can take it for granted, and that’s when it starts causing harm.  

I remember 2020 — I built a bar in my basement. I’d never mixed drinks before, but jeez, trying to keep things balanced while lining up a Margarita, Mojito, Old Fashioned, Cosmopolitan, and Martini? It takes skill, but my god, those mornings after. Don’t even get me started. If you’re older than 30 (or younger, jeez), those mornings where it takes half the day to feel human again? That’s when you realize your body isn’t built for this. It’s great in the moment, but long-term? Not for me.

So yeah, ups and downs like anything. But it’s been nice curbing it a bit these last few years. Waking up to coffee and tech articles without a hangover? Priceless.
