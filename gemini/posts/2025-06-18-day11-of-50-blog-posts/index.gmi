## Day 11, What is your current relationship with technology? Do you enjoy it? Does it cause you anxiety?

Its complicated. I love technology but its lately been giving me more an more anxiety. Mostly because I was one of those people who drew alot of self satisfaction at being a programmer. Specifically, spending the time and money it would take to get really good at specific languages. Really get the benefit from those languages and really crank out ideas into code. As such, I thought I would code the rest of my life, enjoying the whiskey and keystrokes. Cursing into my dying breathe that I finally found the one comma I had errantly put onto the end of a code block. But given where AI is at, I worry that Moore's Law could be in play, that the bet I made as a six year old was wrong and im cooked.

I still love technology and more over, I love the internet. In the communities ive been apart of and the people connected with. I've found so many, many amazing people that I never would have known about without it. 

So I still enjoy tech. With the caveat it can do a lot of good, but can also do harm and I really, realllly hope im not helping the latter.
