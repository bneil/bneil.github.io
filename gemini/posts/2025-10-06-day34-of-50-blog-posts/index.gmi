## Write a book review of the last book you couldn't put down.

How to Sell a Haunted House, by Grady Hendrix

I don't want to give anything away from this book. Just read it,
because its one of these horror stories that is so well written.
Its better than horror. Its god damn interesting.

I think what I liked most was just the feelings of 'yeah, this character
has every right to dislike their brother.' Then at the turn of a hat.

ooooooooooo
oooo
oo

damn.

The book takes turns at break neck speeds and its amazing to go along for the ride.

Also creepy. So damn creepy. But at the same time, funny as all hell. That special
place in my genre where Chucky lives and runs wild.

So yeah, if you want to read a story about a women who recently lost her parents.
Who gets to catch up with her younger bro and learn about her moms strange obsession with a special little doll.

You can't go wrong with this exceptionally odd, fun and well written novel
