# on-gitter



Back in the day, when I was daily using scala. I truly enjoyed the client 'gitter' for communicating to all the cool folks over in the scala ecosystem. So today I was having some nostalgia for my old friends and decided to fire up my old client. Rather than being
greeted with the usual rooms, turns out it was upgrade time! More than that it looks like it switched to a client called 'Element' and that they now support matrix. I've been following matrix somewhat just as an alternative to IRC, but again, I haven't jumped into
that tech in awhile but ive been following Beeper which also allows a matrix client. Honestly, can't wait

for that to come out. 

So anyway, got element installed and am attached to gitter.im. Saw some of the folks I remember hanging out with and im looking forward to reconnecting to some folks.
