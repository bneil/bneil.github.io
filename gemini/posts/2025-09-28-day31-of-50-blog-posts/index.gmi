## Day 31, Is there a particular country other than your own that fascinates you? Why?

Canada. I love hiking, reading and biking. Yamaska National Park near Quebec holds a long
time ache in my heart as id read about it in a national geographic when I was a kid.
Just looked amazing. Also ive watch youtube hikers and bikers from Canada exercising those
trails and I always find myself wishing it was me.

Otherwise, yeah, just always been a bucket list of mine.

Oh, and ever since the host of Jeopardy past away, Ive wanted to make a pilgramage to see Ontario.
Specifically Greater Sudbury, so yeah, I think at some point im going to have to road trip it or
get on a plane.
