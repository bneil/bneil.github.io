## Day 15, Are you an early or late adopter of technology? What makes you that way?

I’d say I’m an early adopter for any technology that’s affordable. If it’s cheap, I’ve picked it up or deployed it in some fashion—often with mixed results. In fact, while not physical tech, when Docker first got on the scene, I was installing so much random software it might as well have been a CD of shareware. I’d spin up containers for half-baked projects, break them, rebuild them, and repeat until something stuck. It wasn’t about utility; it was about curiosity.

I love deploying software and seeing what unique take some tool will have over another. I love experimenting with new workflows utilizing technology. I love failing. There’s a strange satisfaction in burning through a dozen half-working apps, only to retreat to a pen and notebook, scribbling ideas that might one day become the next obsession.

So much of technology is this push and pull. 

This excitement cycle to finally have the friction leave, to have a promise fulfilled, only to find out that it was kinda nice before technology was around. Efficiency isn’t always the point - sometimes it’s the struggle that makes the solution feel earned.

I’ve said it a lot over the years: I didn’t think in the early 90’s that the internet was going to be that large. When I was connecting to BBS’s or even AOL, it didn’t feel like the web was vast. We had physical yellow page book with urls to most sites, it felt like a clubhouse. I wouldn’t have thought so many people would be using it so much back then to now. Kinda crazy.

And yet, here we are. The cycle continues. I’m still chasing the rush of trying new tech, something that might not work, something that might vanish in a year. Maybe it’s the thrill of the unknown, or maybe I’m just addicted to tinkering. 

Either way, I can’t wait to see what great towers rise and fall over the coming decades. Fragmented sentences aside, I’m grateful RSS is still around, heh, proof that some tech doesn’t need to much to survive. It just takes root.
