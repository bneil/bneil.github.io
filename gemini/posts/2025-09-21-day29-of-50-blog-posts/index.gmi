## Day 29, Can you make a list of 20 moments in your current or past life that you would classify as sublime?

Not sure about past life, but if i could, here are 20 from this life (ill attempt chronogical):

* Seeing an alleyway, from the corner of my eye, it looked like the entrance to fairye. kid you not.
* Using a bottle rocket with my dad. Almost took my eye out.
* Fixing a computer for the first time. just kept trying.
* Learning to read via Calvin and Hobbes comics thanks to my grandfather
* Watching the universe unfold from a dark camp site. I had never known the milky way was there.
* Leaving the house at 5am with my cousin and collecting shells. She's gone now but that memory is bedrock.
* Playing mario brothers at a circuit city. I died to the first goomba.
* Failing to win a bowling league tournament, sometimes not winning is sublime. But i went from last place to second. round after round.
* Running faster then my friend could bike.
* Punching a guy who had pushed a girl I liked off the monkey bars. We both went to the principal and played it off.
* Learned to ride a bike by myself, just kept trying. Got to ride with my cousins for the first time afterwards.
* Got picked student of the year at my elementary school. never felt so much pride and guilt.
* Going to the middle school I wanted to go to, even though it meant id be alone, even though my two best friends had promised to follow me. Got to do you.
* Made my own network protocol and BBS variant for a science fair. lost to a claw machine. learned that marketing is important.
* Got the bus driver in high school to stop by a burger king. Felt like I rolled a nat 20. sublime.
* When I still had a best friend. We drank screwdrivers. First time I woke up to fucking chaos. Wouldnt have changed it for anything.
* First time I ran 15 miles. I almost called for a pickup, then just kept trucking.
* First time I played piano for an audience. the sheet music dropped, but i just played from memory. Felt really good.
* Leaving, high school, and the world just fell away. until I woke up in a studio in Arizona. Had the couch my friends and I had salvaged. That was it.
* Playing chess with my friend, before I left AZ. Was one of the longest games ive ever played.

I could keep going, specifically, the esclator of life, eg having getting married and the kids were more than sublime.

But its hard. Life is long and its very interesting and this prompt is amazing but it is hard to quantify just 20 moments.
