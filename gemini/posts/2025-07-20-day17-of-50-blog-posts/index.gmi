# Day 17, What are your favorite books and why?

Rather then complain about just how many books id like to recommend or say how special they were lets go!

Anything by these authors
* Danial Suarez: My guy, somehow every book just hits with me. Daemon/Freedom being the first that got me hooked
* Grady Hendrix: This guy can write some characters and make horror just a delight. I don't even blink when buying his books
* Neal Stephenson: Reamde and so many good ideas and books. I love how the dude is able to throw himself into the future

Great Reads
* Anything by Jim Butcher. Special shoutout to my boy Dresden.
* Dungeon Crawler Carl. The book is good. The audio book is NEXT. FUCKING. LEVEL.


Honorable Mentions
* Monk and the robot: The chill, I have never enjoyed a character driven book nearly as much as ive enjoyed this quick read.
* The this: Could have gone with john dies at the end but make 'the this' just sticks in my soul
* This perfect day: It was a good day. jk. Again, like the drug induced population vs human nature.

So many good books. I could recommend more but really, it depends.
