# About Me

---------------------------
![imerror](/images/error-avatar.jpg)

My name is Benjamin Neil, a polyglot engineer in Colorado. I have had the privilege to work the 
past eleven years making websites, services, documentation and tools for amazing companies.

I'm obsessed with technology and programming - mainy linux, hypervisors, containers, unikernels, 
scala, rust, go etc. Ive got a real problem researching tools and enjoy writing then rewriting 
internal documentation.

# Publications

Recently (well in 2016) I co-authored a book called [Professional Scala](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-Scala.productCd-1119267226.html), it was an exciting experience and I really enjoyed the feedback from the scala community.
