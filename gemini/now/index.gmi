_Last Updated: {{}}_

Mostly im working really hard at keeping the engineering side of my startup going the
correct direction while trying to balance life. Im becoming more and more obsessed with
determining the best way to store and retrieve information from my notes that seem to
be spread across ten different applications. I do have this intrensic want to combine both
my work projects and home projects in one solid system. Which as of now is the popular PARA method.

## Reading
*  Atomic Habits (good so far)
*  Digital Zettelkasten
