March, Been a quick few weeks, and as usual that means I just forget to update this section of my life. Its funny how I look forward to writing on here
and then never have time for it. But in anycase, been doing lots of bike rides since the weather has been more amenable as of late. Also been trying this
"vibe" coding, which if im honest is more or progress quest simulator. Its a unique way of coding that I really enjoy to some extent, I like the boilerplate
being done for me. Much in the same way ive always worked to metaprogram, but now it feels the AI is helping me come up with more sophisticated ways at getting
rid of repetitive tasks.

So its fun. Been trying to do more art and just get out for more walks.
