Hello September, its always hard letting go of summer, it might just be that kid in me but its hard to feel the weather shift. To accept that its another end to a wonderful season. I love the warmness and general happiness, of people actually taking time off for family that doesn't feel forced. But, it is what it is. So far this month ive been focused on Flutter, on firebase functions and in creating some day 2 operations for some fine clients. Im very grateful for the work and excited to be coding.

This has also been the first time ive been using AI to aid in development. I've been pressured to use 'cursor' but haven't yet. It's really interesting to be kinda pushed towards using this new tech and im excited to see if 'cursor' is able to do the job. The more cynacially part of me, expects lots or rework. But who knows. maybe its getting better. I'm excited to try.

Cheers to octoberfest! 🍻
