<p/>
The past month has been challenging. I stopped working full time at the startup I co-founded, this outside of the feelings of mixed disappointment has been a challenge in getting back to first principles. I love coding, collaborating and discovering new solutions for hard problems. So its been hard to slow down and focus on next steps. 

Just saying if your here and reading this, maybe head over to my resume if you want to play some basic space invaders and maybe we can collab sometime ðŸ˜Š
