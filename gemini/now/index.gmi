Month of June is really go by fast. Already half way through. Spent a nice weekend away at Pogosa Springs and took in some nice hiking. Was thinking about how to get more clients for the majority of the time. Its really surprising just how much I think about work now that I have to drum up all the work to keep myself employeed. 

On the fun side, Canonical sent me two passes on Fathers Day. So the hits keep coming. Well, still, its fun to try and get interviews from companies you care about regardless of the result. So going to keep trying to apply places and get clients in the interum.
