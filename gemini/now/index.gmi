November. Had to take a little time off from posting on the ol blog. Was very occupied with getting a company going for the past few months. Its been so quick, that this breather has come as a welcome respite even though I still have to line up something new. Oh, in social media news, ive been trying out mastadon on the indieweb.social site, blue sky and threads. So far blue sky is definatly got that old twitter feel. Now, as usually is the problem, I don't know what to post. lol. Anyway, happy November!
