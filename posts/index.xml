It all started with finding a webring. I hadnt seen one since the mid 90&amp;rsquo;s and the accidental stumbling upon one was almost magical. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had the pleasure, a web ring was this piece of tech that was largely social. It was a way of finding genres of websites you were interested in and daisy chaining between them.
