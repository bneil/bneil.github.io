Lots and lots of pain. Including the fact id probably end up having to use dynamodb streams and couple that with elasticsearch. So im not going to even entertain that idea and am going down the ol trusty sql route.
Creating the database Im still on an older version of terraform, so public shamming for being on 0.</description></item><item><title>Audit Service - Dynamodb</title><link>/posts/audit-dynamodb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 11:13:53 -0600</pubDate><guid>/posts/audit-dynamodb/</guid><description>Audit Service Description Decided that I wanted an audit db and service to help keep track of user behaviors. Since I already have some in Redis, and some in Postgres I thought this might be a useful exercise. The main thing id like to accomplish with this code is going to be a way to track events and break them down by week/month/year per user and per company.
Im having some self debate about creating tables for the tallies or if I should just be creating them on the fly using a query.</description></item><item><title>Dynamo DB Pages</title><link>/posts/dynamodb_pages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 10:33:49 -0600</pubDate><guid>/posts/dynamodb_pages/</guid><description>Dynamo code snippet Recently got burned because we needed to do a recursive paging through dynamo
